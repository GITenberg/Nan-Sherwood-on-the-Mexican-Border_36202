<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>UNEXPECTED GUESTS</small></h2>


<p>Elizabeth Harley jumped down from her bicycle
and dropped it noisily against the steps of
the Sherwood back porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, oh, Nan!&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>There was no answer. She ran up the steps and
into the cottage, letting the screen door bang behind
her. A friend since primary school days of
Nan Sherwood, she was like one of the family and
always ran into the Sherwood home on Amity
Street without the formality of ringing the doorbell
or pausing to knock.</p>

<p>Now she was more than anxious to find Nan.
She had something important to tell her, news,
she felt, that had to be told right away.</p>

<p>Grace and Rhoda and Laura and Amelia, the
whole crowd that had gone to England to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
king and queen crowned in Westminster the year
before were coming to Tillbury by motor to spend
a couple of weeks. Nan and Bess had invited them
during the last busy days at school, but Bess had
only just now received a telegram saying they
could come. Oh, there was so much to do!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, Nan!&rdquo; she called again. They would
have to have parties and picnics and hikes. Bess&rsquo;s
mind was busy planning even as she wondered
where in the world Nan was. They would have a
steak fry down on the shore of the lake. They
would stay late and after the moon was up, they
would sit on the shore and sing and talk and build
the fire up high and then when the embers were
low, they would toast marshmallows and talk
some more until it was time to go home. But
where was Nan?</p>

<p>Bess called again. Again there was no answer,
but Bess heard the sound of voices in the front of
the house. She walked on through. Excited herself,
she failed to notice the excitement in the voices
that attracted her, so when she stuck her head
through the door between the hall and the Sherwood
front parlor, she was taken completely by
surprise.</p>

<p>There were strangers in the room! Bess withdrew
her head in embarrassment, but Nan had
seen her and came towards her laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess,&rdquo; she said, reaching her hand out toward
her friend and pulling her into the room.
&ldquo;Come on in, you are just the person we wanted
to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bess, it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood nodded
her head reassuringly at her daughter&rsquo;s young
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, lassie, come in,&rdquo; one of the strangers, a
white-haired old man spoke up. &ldquo;Come over here
by me, and let me look at you.&rdquo; His bright blue
eyes twinkled as he noted the blush on the girl&rsquo;s
cheek but he did nothing to relieve her embarrassment.
On the contrary, he adjusted his glasses on
his nose, and carefully looked her up and down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m, a pretty bit,&rdquo; he smiled as he rendered
his verdict and then reached over and drew
Nan, who was standing close beside Bess, near to
him. &ldquo;So this is another of the lassies who went
over to see the good king crowned,&rdquo; he addressed
his remark to Nan. &ldquo;And I gather you are pretty
good friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and Bess both nodded at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you go to the same school and you pay
attention to your lessons and you mind your own
business?&rdquo; The old gentleman tried to look severe
as he asked these questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We try to, sir.&rdquo; Bess found her voice at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You obey your elders and you think you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
going to spend your vacation here in Tillbury, a
God-forsaken place, with a half dozen bright
lassies like yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir.&rdquo; Bess didn&rsquo;t know
what to answer. This strange old man was like no
one she had ever met before. She wanted to protest
that Tillbury was not a God-forsaken place,
that she and Nan both liked it, but she didn&rsquo;t quite
dare. She wanted to speak up and tell him that
vacation in Tillbury with all her friends would be
fun, but she didn&rsquo;t dare do that either. She didn&rsquo;t
quite know what to think of this white-haired
gentleman who seemed so fond of Nan and was
so outspoken. In her confusion, she was tongue-tied.</p>

<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t. Each time that he opened his
mouth, the words that came forth were more astonishing
than they had been before. Bess found
herself listening in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not going to stay here in Tillbury
for the summer,&rdquo; he continued his discussion
of Bess and Nan&rsquo;s vacation. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it. And
your friends aren&rsquo;t going to either. You&rsquo;re all
coming with me. England one summer, and Tillbury
the next. Forsooth! I thought you all had
more imagination than that. You, Nan, I&rsquo;m disappointed
in you.&rdquo; His eyes twinkled merrily as
he looked at his young cousin, for the stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
was Adair MacKenzie, first cousin to Mrs. Sherwood,
and a wealthy Memphis, Tennessee, business
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see, when can we start?&rdquo; He took
out his watch as he spoke. &ldquo;Hm-m-m. It will take
a little time to pack,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Lassies are
such fussy creatures. They have to have two or
three dresses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two or three!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, cousin
Adair, we have to have just dozens if we are going
to stay away all summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said you were?&rdquo; The old Scotchman
roared and then threw back his head and laughed
long and heartily at the young girl who seemed so
self-possessed no matter what he said or did. Nan
laughed with him and then, turning toward Bess,
she introduced her eccentric old relative and his
pretty daughter, Alice, a young lady about five
years older than Nan who, up to this time, had
said nothing, but had watched her father with
amusement.</p>

<p>At the introduction, Adair MacKenzie bowed
gracefully and, taking Bess&rsquo;s hand lightly in his,
kissed it quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice lassie,&rdquo; he said
then. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s all sit down and talk a while
about this trip to Mexico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mexico!&rdquo; Bess was wide-eyed as the exclamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
slipped off her tongue. &ldquo;Are we going to
Mexico?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. That was all settled weeks ago,&rdquo;
MacKenzie knitted his brows as he looked at Bess.
&ldquo;Such a bright young lassie and yet she didn&rsquo;t
know that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind father,&rdquo; Alice took Bess&rsquo;s hand in
hers. &ldquo;He goes about planning all these things
and never says anything to anyone until he has
everything all ready. It used to wear me out, but
now I think it is quite charming of him. Of course,
it keeps everyone at home in a constant state of
turmoil and it makes the housekeeper furious, but
then we manage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manage!&rdquo; the old man exploded again.
&ldquo;Manage! Why, you imp, you, you love it and
you know you do. It&rsquo;s the spice of life to you.
Mexico, Europe, Alaska, South America, Egypt,
why, the world&rsquo;s a place to live in, not just to read
about. India and China and Japan, these are
places we haven&rsquo;t been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And daddy, we&rsquo;re not going just yet.&rdquo; Alice
acted as though she wanted to forestall any possibility
of their starting off the next day or the next
hour for the Orient. &ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s Mexico
we&rsquo;re going to this summer. We&rsquo;re going to live
in that big hacienda that was dumped into your
hands when you sued those clients of yours that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were exporters in Mexico City. Oh, daddy, remember,
when you came back the last time, you
said it was a grand old place with gorgeous vines
flinging scarlet sprays all over everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. I said that the sunsets were
more gorgeous, the birds more brilliant, the
flowers brighter, the moon more silver, the sea
bluer than anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that wasn&rsquo;t all you said,&rdquo; Alice seemed to
be baiting her father now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo; He fell right into the trap of the
daughter whom he adored. &ldquo;I said also that there
was a bunch of darn Mexicans cluttering up the
place down there who put the politeness of us
Southerners to shame. Never saw anything like
it,&rdquo; he turned to Mrs. Sherwood with this. &ldquo;They
fall all over themselves every time they turn
around, and women just eat it up. Can&rsquo;t stand it
myself. Never get anything done. Have to change
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood laughed softly at this. Adair
had not changed a bit since she saw him last, and
that was longer ago than she liked to remember.
That was at her wedding. She smiled now to herself
in recalling it. She and Bob, in their anxiety
to escape from the wedding reception without
being followed, had taken Adair into their confidence.
He had promised to get them a horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
buggy, to see that they got off safely to the train
that was to bring them up North on their honeymoon.
He had told them to leave everything to
him, and, in their innocence, they had.</p>

<p>Adair had meant well, but somehow or other
in his peremptory handling of events, he got
everything in such confusion that practically the
whole town turned out to see the Sherwoods off.
They, in their turn, almost missed the train, for
the horse and buggy never did arrive. However,
it had all turned out happily, and when the bride
and groom stood on the back of the train and
waved to their friends, they had an especially fond
feeling for Adair. He, however, felt pretty glum,
and their last view of him was of a perplexed
young man standing off alone on one corner of the
station platform, wondering how in the world all
of the people had happened to be there.</p>

<p>No, Adair, she could see, hadn&rsquo;t changed a bit.
He still liked to manage people, still liked to follow
up any impulsive idea that came to his active
mind. Through the years, tales of his adventures
had reached her by letter from friends and relatives.
Adair himself was not given to writing.
&ldquo;Takes too much time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sit still
that long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His visit now was a surprise. He had arrived,
unannounced, when she and Nan were in a turmoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
unpacking the trunks that Nan had brought
back from school with her. Only the peremptory
peal of the doorbell had announced his coming.
When she opened the door, he had taken her in
his arms and kissed her and then, without even
introducing Alice whom she had never met, he
began immediately to call for Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that girl?&rdquo; he asked almost before
he was inside the door. &ldquo;Come all the way up
here from Memphis to see her and then she
doesn&rsquo;t even come to greet me.&rdquo; In his impatience,
he pounded on the floor with his cane. Mrs. Sherwood
called her daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Nan,&rdquo; he said positively, when Nan
finally entered the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Adair. I would
have known you anyplace. You look and walk and
talk (Nan hadn&rsquo;t said a word) just like your
mother. The same eyes, the same hair, the same
determined chin. Now I believe everything I&rsquo;ve
been hearing about you. Didn&rsquo;t before. Sounded
like a bunch of nonsense to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young school girl takes part in English coronation.
Young school girl saves child from rattlesnake.
Young school girl saves life of old lady.
Didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it. Now I do. You&rsquo;re going
to Mexico with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adair MacKenzie!&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood exclaimed.
&ldquo;Will you please lay your cane aside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
take off your coat, put your hat down and have a
chair before you go sweeping Nan off her feet
with your scatterbrained ideas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, don&rsquo;t worry, darling,&rdquo; she turned toward
her daughter and laughed. &ldquo;This man is
really quite harmless. He is Adair MacKenzie,
our cousin. Remember, the one we wrote to some
years ago when we were in such trouble. He can&rsquo;t
help being like this. He&rsquo;s always been so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; Adair grinned rather winningly
at Mrs. Sherwood. &ldquo;I must say, Jessie, you
haven&rsquo;t changed either. Still think you can manage
me, do you? Alice,&rdquo; he turned toward his daughter
now for the first time, &ldquo;this woman you see
here is the only woman who ever thought she
could wind me around her finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood and Alice exchanged sympathetic
glances at this. Alice, too, if her father only
knew it, had her ways of managing him. Nan&rsquo;s
mother knew this instinctively and liked Alice.</p>

<p>Nan liked her too. She was tall, slender, with
blond curly hair and deep blue eyes. She was
pretty and happy looking. And she liked Nan and
hoped against hope that her father could work out
his plan to induce Nan and her friends to come to
Mexico with them. She sat quietly by while he
plunged into the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Nancy,&rdquo; he commanded when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had taken off his coat. Nan walked across the
room and stood in front of him. &ldquo;You want to go
to Mexico?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan hesitated. She had never before thought of
going to Mexico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to go to Mexico? Yes, or no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nan hesitated as she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such word. Never say can&rsquo;t to me. Don&rsquo;t
like it. Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
frowned at Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I have friends coming to stay with
me for a few weeks. I can&rsquo;t run away from them.&rdquo;
Nan hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they as nice as you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be modest. They couldn&rsquo;t be. When are
they coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just sure. Perhaps next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right then. They&rsquo;ll come with us.
We&rsquo;ll all go to Mexico together. Now, that&rsquo;s
taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on this decision, that Bess had entered
the room so unexpectedly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>YOU&rsquo;RE GOING WITH ME</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;But do you think the others can go?&rdquo; Bess
asked anxiously when Adair MacKenzie and
Alice had driven off in search of Mr. Sherwood.
&ldquo;To bring him home where he belongs when he
has visitors,&rdquo; Adair had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Momsey?&rdquo; Nan referred
the question to her mother. The three were in the
kitchen where Mrs. Sherwood was bustling about
preparing a company dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good Lord only knows,&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood
shook her head as she sifted more flour on her
biscuit dough and then kneaded it lightly and expertly.
&ldquo;I can only tell you two girls this. When
Adair MacKenzie sets out to do something, he
usually does it. He has a way about him that almost
always wins people over to his side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but to Mexico. He wants to take us all
to Mexico and he doesn&rsquo;t even know us!&rdquo; Bess
couldn&rsquo;t believe it, not even after seeing and hearing
the old Scotchman. &ldquo;And if I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo;
she questioned, &ldquo;how in the world will the others
when they haven&rsquo;t even seen him or heard him
talk?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, Bessie,&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood
looked affectionately at this girl who was almost
a second daughter to her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be both seeing
him and hearing him talk before long now. If I
know Adair MacKenzie at all, he&rsquo;ll be at work on
this thing before another day is up. And if he&rsquo;s
one-half the man he used to be, you might just as
well begin packing tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say you are sure we will all go?&rdquo;
Bess was incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll go and have the grandest time you
ever have had,&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood said confidently.
&ldquo;There never was another man like Adair MacKenzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going?&rdquo; Nan had, despite her cousin&rsquo;s
assurance, been somewhat doubtful. She
knew that her mother had wanted her to stay at
home this summer, that she had been lonesome
without her daughter the summer before and was
planning all sorts of little surprises for this
vacation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go! Of course you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood
nearly dropped her biscuit dough in her surprise
at Nan&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;And I shouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised
if your father and I were to go at least
part way with you. Adair said something about it.
Aye, but he&rsquo;s a thoughtful soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it came about that Rhoda Hammond, Grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and Walter Mason, Amelia &ldquo;Procrastination&rdquo;
Boggs, and Laura Polk, all school chums of Bess
and Nan, in the days that followed, received telegraphic
invitations to spend the summer with Nan
in Mexico.</p>

<p>While each of them is laying her plans, packing
her clothes and wiring &ldquo;Santa Claus&rdquo;, as Laura
Polk immediately dubbed Cousin Adair, let&rsquo;s
briefly review the adventures of Nan Sherwood
and her friends up to this point.</p>

<p>Nan was born in Tillbury, a pleasant little
town, some distance from any big city, and her
early school days were spent with Elizabeth Harley,
the only one of Nan&rsquo;s many friends who has
followed her through all of her adventures.</p>

<p>In the first book of the series, &ldquo;Nan Sherwood
at Pine Camp&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Old Lumberman&rsquo;s Secret&rdquo;
Nan and Bess are pals at Tillbury High
School. Here Nan is extremely popular with all
of her classmates and excels in sports. She and
Bess have grand times together, though the Sherwoods
live on a reduced income while Bess, the
daughter of one of Tillbury&rsquo;s wealthiest families,
has everything that money can buy.</p>

<p>The first big disagreement the girls ever have
comes in the opening chapters of this book when
Bess, having decided to go away to an exclusive
boarding school on the shores of Lake Michigan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
tries to induce Nan to go with her. Though Nan
wants with all her heart to go, she absolutely refuses
to ask her parents because she knows that
they cannot afford to let her. She is happy later
at her decision, because on the eve of it, she discovers
that her father has lost his job in the Tillbury
Mills. Everything looks extremely dark for
the Sherwoods. Momsey Sherwood is ill and Papa
Sherwood, because of his age, is complete at a
loss as to know where to turn for a job.</p>

<p>However, when things are darkest, Mrs. Sherwood
receives two letters. One from Scotland informs
her that she is sole heir of a fortune in
Scotland, and the other, from her cousin Adair
MacKenzie, whom we have already met, promises
her aid until such time as she can collect on her
inheritance. With this, Nan&rsquo;s parents leave for
Scotland and pack Nan off to Northern Wisconsin
where she spends an exciting year in the lumber
country with an uncle and aunt. Here, in chapter
after chapter that are full of thrills for Nan,
those about her, and the reader, the plucky young
girl solves a mystery that, in the end, clears her
uncle&rsquo;s title to a valuable piece of property.</p>

<p>In the next volume of the series, &ldquo;Nan Sherwood
at Lakeview Hall&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Mystery of the
Haunted Boathouse&rdquo; our young heroine goes off
to school with Bess. And there never was a nicer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
school anyplace than Lakeview Hall. Situated on
a bluff overlooking the lake it&rsquo;s like an old castle.
Mrs. Cupp, assistant to Dr. Beulah Prescott, is
the keeper and the girls, early in the volume, learn
to respect her, if not to admire her. Here, they
make the acquaintance of a number of new
friends.</p>

<p>There are Grace Mason and her brother Walter,
children of a wealthy Chicago family; Laura
Polk, a red-headed girl whose lively imagination
and ready tongue are constantly getting her into
difficulties; Amelia Boggs, a serious book-loving
soul with a roomful of clocks; and finally, Linda
Riggs, a snobbish, spoiled child, who is extremely
jealous of Nan and her well-deserved popularity.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, there is the boathouse ghost
around whom is woven a mystery that brings Nan
and Walter Mason together in such a way that
they develop a keen admiration for one another.
This book is chock full of adventure, excitement
and mystery and Lakeview Hall is the center of
it all.</p>

<p>Her friendship with Grace and Walter bring
about her next big experience, a visit to Chicago.
In &ldquo;Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s Winter Holidays&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rescuing
the Runaways&rdquo; the Lakeview Hall crowd
spends Christmas vacation in Grace Mason&rsquo;s palatial
Chicago home. The story of Nan&rsquo;s meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with a very famous movie star and her solution
to the mystery surrounding the strange disappearance
of two young farm girls who have come to
the city to go into the movies is recounted in this
volume.</p>

<p>Next, Nan and her friends go off on a visit to
a western ranch, the home of Rhoda Hammond,
a school chum. Here the northern girls get their
first taste of what it is to live in the wide open
spaces of the west. The story of lost treasure that
is told in this volume of the series, &ldquo;Nan Sherwood
at Rose Ranch&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Old Mexican&rsquo;s
Treasure&rdquo; is one that no admirer of plucky Nan
Sherwood would want to miss.</p>

<p>The year that follows this western adventure
is a pleasant one at Lakeview Hall and at its end,
we find Nan and her friends trekking off to Florida
and Palm Beach. So, in &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at
Palm Beach&rdquo; or &ldquo;Strange Adventures Among the
Orange Groves&rdquo; in a background of wide sandy
beaches, beautiful graceful palms, and a hotel that
overlooks the sea, a villain who has tried to cheat
one of Nan&rsquo;s many acquaintances out of her fortune,
comes to a well-deserved end, and Nan
emerges a heroine once more. At the end of this
volume, we find that Walter and Nan are becoming
more and more fond of one another, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
see the Lakeview Hall girls teasing them about it
again and again.</p>

<p>In the sixth volume, Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s Scotch
connections bring about an invitation to Nan to
visit Scotland and the family estate of her mother&rsquo;s
people. Bess is heartbroken that her friend is
going away without her. However, she tries to
conceal her disappointment and joins with Nan&rsquo;s
other friends in planning a grand farewell party.
The party proves to be a surprise all round and
the great day ends with an announcement by Dr.
Prescott that she is taking a party of six girls
abroad to see the king and queen of England
crowned! Such excitement! Such last minute rush!
Such fun! Never was there a happier, more exciting,
more adventurous crossing of the ocean than
the Lakeview Hall crowd enjoyed on the S.&nbsp;S.
Lincoln. And the whole is rounded out in
the last chapter with Nan as a lady-in-waiting to
the Queen at the coronation. How this all came
about is a story that all Nan Sherwood fans will
want to read.</p>

<p>It was the part his little cousin had played in
the coronation that made Adair MacKenzie resolve
to hunt her up. It was this that brought him
to Tillbury and the cottage on Amity street on the
day the present volume opens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good biscuits!&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie bit off a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
piece of their lightness the evening the present
story opens. They were all sitting at the Sherwood
dinner table. There he sat, chewing reflectively, as
he glanced down the table at young Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you helped crown the good queen,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t go to your head. You&rsquo;re a
good lass. You Blakes,&rdquo; he turned to Mrs. Sherwood
now, &ldquo;were always a bunch of modest creatures.
That&rsquo;s why I like you. Now, Bessie there,&rdquo;
he pointed to Bess who had stayed for dinner,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s not so modest, but she&rsquo;s kind and loyal.
She&rsquo;s a little spoiled, but she&rsquo;ll get by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess blushed all shades of the rainbow at
Adair&rsquo;s frankness. Used to being babied and
somewhat pampered at home, his outspokenness
troubled her. She felt strangely like crying. Nan
caught her eye and smiled encouragingly. Mrs.
Sherwood patted her hand beneath the tablecloth.
And Alice, well, Alice was a dear, for she turned
the conversation toward school, and both Nan
and Bess utterly forgot themselves in telling of
the horse show in which they had both taken part
during the last week at school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you think you can ride, eh?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
was secretly pleased at both of the young
girls. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll put you each on a Mexican
mule and let you try to climb a mountain and
see what happens.&rdquo; He chuckled at the thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice laughed merrily at this. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll
never get me on one,&rdquo; she vowed. &ldquo;Once was
enough. Instead of the mule pulling me up the
narrow path, I pulled the mule up. I never worked
harder in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my sweet, you never worked at all.&rdquo;
Adair shook his finger at his daughter. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
work this summer&mdash;if that old housekeeper of
ours keeps her resolution not to go down to that
dirty hole which we call a hacienda. The words
are hers,&rdquo; he explained to Nan and Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She once, when she was a very young girl,
spent a summer on a sugar beet farm here in the
north. A lot of Mexicans worked on it. They were
miserably treated and poorly paid. As a result
their huts were like hovels. She saw some of them
and now she says that wild horses couldn&rsquo;t drag
her into that country down there. She&rsquo;d rather see
me starve first. But I&rsquo;ll get her yet.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
smiled as though he liked opposition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show her who is boss,&rdquo; he ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will, daddy,&rdquo; Alice agreed.
&ldquo;But now tell us, when are we going? How long
are we going to stay? And whom have you
invited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last question put Adair MacKenzie in a
corner and he knew it. Really, a very kind and
extremely impulsive soul, when he went on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
summer jaunts for pleasure he was apt to go about
for weeks, inviting all his friends. As a result, no
matter how large the house was he rented, it was
always too small, and no matter what preparation
Alice made for guests, they were always inadequate.</p>

<p>Now, as he sat thinking, a mischievous light
came into his eye. &ldquo;There is only one that I&rsquo;ve
invited,&rdquo; he teased, &ldquo;besides these girls that will
interest you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walker Jamieson, that smart-alecky reporter
that we met in San Francisco a couple of years
ago. Remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember? Of course I remember and he
wasn&rsquo;t smart alecky. He was kind and sweet
and&mdash;&rdquo; But Alice didn&rsquo;t finish her sentence, for
she became conscious of the fact that all the eyes
around the dinner table were on her. She blushed
prettily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she justified herself, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be a help
in handling you, for he&rsquo;s smart, almost as smart
as you are, daddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A reporter! You mean to say a real newspaper
reporter will be down there with us?&rdquo; Nan
couldn&rsquo;t contain herself any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, a no good reporter.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
tried hard to look disdainful as he said this, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he didn&rsquo;t succeed very well and both Nan and Bess
guessed that he had a genuine regard for the
&ldquo;young scamp&rdquo; as he called him. &ldquo;Got to have
someone around,&rdquo; he muttered as he drank his
coffee, &ldquo;to help handle you women, even if it&rsquo;s a
young scalawag who spends all his time tracking
down stories for your worthless newspaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stories!&rdquo; Bess and Nan were wide-eyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; Adair shook his finger in the
direction of the two young girls, &ldquo;reporters are
no good. They&rsquo;re a lazy lot that hang around
with their feet on desks pretending to think.
Think! Why, I never knew one yet that had a
thought worth telling, let alone writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one that you are going to meet is no
better than the rest. M-m-m, and no worse
either,&rdquo; he conceded as he noted the expression
on Alice&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I asked him to come along because
he has a knack of making things lively wherever
he is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon&rsquo;s he gets those two big feet of his down
off his desk, he makes things hum. That&rsquo;s the way
he is, lazy one minute, full of action the next. If
there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing happening, he knows
how to stir things up. I rather like a man like that&mdash;not
that I like him,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;but if
we&rsquo;re going to go across the border this summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
got to have someone like him around. Might just
as well be Jamieson as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will he write stories while we&rsquo;re there
and will they be in the paper?&rdquo; Nan was reluctant
to let the conversation about the young reporter
drop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never can tell anything about people like
him,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie shook his head as though
he would be the last person in the world to predict
anything about reporters. Could he have
looked into the future he would have shaken it
even more violently, for in the next few weeks
Walker Jamieson, with the help of Nan and the
Lakeview Hall crowd, was to uncover in Mexico
one of the biggest stories of the year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>ADAIR MACKENZIE SPEAKS UP</small></h2>


<p>It all started in Laredo, Texas, just after Nan
and her guests had been met by Adair MacKenzie,
Alice, and that amazing young newspaper
man, Walker Jamieson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got everything?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie asked
gruffly when the bevy of pretty young girls, all in
their early teens, had stepped, one after the other,
from the streamlined train that had brought them
from St. Louis. They had met in that city, all except
Rhoda whose home, as those who have read
&ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Rose Ranch&rdquo; will remember,
was in the South. She, therefore, had joined the
party at beautiful San Antonio. From there on,
the girls had all been together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I-I guess so,&rdquo; Nan answered her eccentric
old cousin slowly as she looked about first at her
friends and then at the suitcases and bags that the
porters were setting on the station platform beside
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks it.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie agreed laconically.
&ldquo;Got almost as many bags as Alice here and
I thought that she carried more junk than any
other woman alive. So these are the girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
H-m-m.&rdquo; He looked at the Lakeview Hall group
in much the same manner that he had appraised
Bess just three weeks before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; he began, and Nan&rsquo;s eyes twinkled
as she realized that he was not going to keep his
conclusions to himself any more than he had before.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Laura,&rdquo; he said positively, picking
the red-headed girl out of the crowd as though
he had studied a photograph of her until he
couldn&rsquo;t possibly mistake her features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that red hair&rsquo;s going to get you in trouble
sometime,&rdquo; he continued his characterization.
&ldquo;Got a temper now. I can see that. A ready
tongue too, I&rsquo;ll wager. But you&rsquo;ll get by if you
can go on laughing at yourself. You&rsquo;ve got a sense
of humor. Keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Laura answered as meekly as she
could. She had already been warned, on the train,
by Bess as to what to expect, so this frank analysis
of her character did not take her altogether by
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Miss,&rdquo; the old Scotsman went on
around the circle of girls enjoying himself hugely
as he characterized his young cousin&rsquo;s friends,
&ldquo;you,&rdquo; he was looking at Amelia as he spoke, &ldquo;are
the one that has all of those clocks. You&rsquo;re too
serious. You&rsquo;ll learn down here in this lazy country
that time just doesn&rsquo;t matter. Ask anybody to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
do anything for you and he&rsquo;ll nod his head slowly
and mutter, if he&rsquo;s got enough pep, &lsquo;Si, si, señor,
mañana!&rsquo; He&rsquo;ll do anything in the world you want
him to do, mañana, and mañana never comes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, you and I will get along. I like you.
You are punctual. It&rsquo;s a virtue. Never been late
for anything in your life, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amelia hardly knew what to answer, for
Adair had made time seem both important and
unimportant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak up,&rdquo; the old man looked at her kindly
now. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be modest like my young cousin here.
Well, never mind,&rdquo; he passed Amelia by as he saw
that he had embarrassed her beyond her ability
to speak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you later,&rdquo; he ended
before he turned to Rhoda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the West, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he questioned
the proud brown-eyed young girl. &ldquo;Can tell in a
minute. That carriage, the way you hold your
head, your clear eyes. Even if I hadn&rsquo;t heard that
Western accent, I would have known.&rdquo; Adair
MacKenzie was proud of his ability to read character,
and as he went from one of the young
lassies to the other, he was pleased with himself
and pleased with them, for their quiet acceptance
of his outspokenness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A city girl. Just a little too shy.&rdquo; Grace&rsquo;s turn
came last, and she had been dreading it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
got to learn to stick up for your own rights,&rdquo; he
had struck home here, he knew, and though he
realized that Grace could take it with less equilibrium
than any of the rest, he wasn&rsquo;t going to
spare her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, &lsquo;boo,&rsquo; to you,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll
run. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace said nothing, but nodded her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try saying &lsquo;boo!&rsquo; back sometime,&rdquo; he advised
in a quieter tone than he had used to any of
the other girls, &ldquo;and see what happens. If the person
you say it to doesn&rsquo;t run, stand your ground
and say it again, louder. But be careful,&rdquo; he patted
Grace on the shoulder, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t scare yourself
with your own voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this everyone laughed, including Grace, and
Alice MacKenzie took her father by the arm and
started toward the station. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look out,
father,&rdquo; she warned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;boo!&rsquo; to you and
then you&rsquo;ll jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go along with you,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
pounded his cane on the wooden platform, and
then shook it at his daughter, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t behave
yourself, I&rsquo;ll give you one last spanking that
will hold you until you are as old and gray as I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Alice laughed provocatively up
into his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, come on, you girls,&rdquo; Adair frowned as
best he could under the circumstances, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got
to get along. And you too, you get a move on,&rdquo; he
pointed his cane, with this, at a tall, lanky blond
young man.</p>

<p>At this, Nan and Bess, Rhoda and Grace,
Laura and Amelia with one accord turned their
eyes on Walker Jamieson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real, girls.&rdquo; Walker grinned down into
their faces. &ldquo;It moves and speaks, eats and sleeps
just like the rest of the world. It does everything
but work.&rdquo; So saying, he winked quite openly at
Alice and lengthened his steps so that he walked
beside her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First truth I&rsquo;ve ever heard you utter,&rdquo; Adair
MacKenzie tried to sound brusk, but didn&rsquo;t succeed
very well. The truth was, of course, that he
was intensely pleased with the prospect of spending
his summer with this crowd of young people.
And, though he would be the last person in the
world to admit it, he was intensely flattered that
this brilliant young newspaper man was in the
party. &ldquo;Not that he came,&rdquo; he thought to himself
as he noted, with some satisfaction, the regard
with which Walker seemed to hold Alice, &ldquo;to keep
me company.&rdquo; He sighed deeply as he finished the
thought. Alice was his only child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got everything?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the question with which he greeted the girls as
they all approached the customs office. &ldquo;Baggage
checks? Tourist cards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, they all opened their purses and rummaged
around in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shades of Glasgow.&rdquo; Laura murmured into
Nan&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Seems good to be going through this
red tape again, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan nodded. She felt much the same as she
did the day they had first stepped foot on foreign
soil, an unforgettable experience that they all had
talked over again and again since that morning
in May when the great boat had been moored to
the dock and they had walked, one after the other,
down the gangplank to set their feet in Scotland
for the first time. The adventures that had followed
had made their vacation the most exciting
of their lives as those who have read &ldquo;Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
Summer Holidays&rdquo; all agree. Now, as
they all walked forward toward the offices of the
Mexican officials, Nan wondered idly what further
adventures were in store for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Señorita, your bag, señorita.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer when you are called?&rdquo;
Walker Jamieson dropped back into step beside
Nan. &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he prodded Nan with his elbow,
&ldquo;the handsome young Mexican with the neat little
mustache that is running after us, is calling you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s voice had a surprised ring to it.
&ldquo;Am I Señorita?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None other, for months to come, now.&rdquo; Walker
Jamieson answered. &ldquo;You are Señorita Sherwood
and you had better answer when these
Señores call or they will be so much insulted that
they will never recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Nan looked genuinely regretful
as she turned to the tall thin native that had
been following her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he dismissed her concern with
a wave of his hands, &ldquo;but the Señorita has
dropped her purse. May I give it to her?&rdquo; He
bowed gracefully as he presented it, and Nan felt
that he couldn&rsquo;t possibly have presented the finest
gift in the world with more grace.</p>

<p>However, before she could possibly thank him,
he disappeared. She turned to follow the others
into the offices, rummaging through her purse,
even as they had done, as she went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Nan looked first at her purse
and then in the direction in which the obliging
young Mexican had vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh, we should have guessed,&rdquo; Walker
Jamieson shook his head sadly. &ldquo;Dumb of me.
What did he get?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My visitor&rsquo;s pass!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;Now,
what will I do?&rdquo; Involuntarily, they both looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
toward Adair MacKenzie who was just disappearing
through the door. Then they laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, kid,&rdquo; Walker liked this youngster
that Alice had already filled his ears with
tales about. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re in for it. It&rsquo;s tough, these
days, getting duplicates of the things. Shall I
break the news to the ogre,&rdquo; he nodded in Adair
MacKenzie&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll explode, but you&rsquo;ve
just got to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>TROUBLE AT THE BORDER</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Here, here, what&rsquo;s eating you two?&rdquo; Adair
MacKenzie came bursting forth from the door he
had entered just a few moments before Nan&rsquo;s encounter
with the Mexican. &ldquo;H-m-m, lost your
pass, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo; With the uncanny instinct of
many peppery old gentlemen, Adair MacKenzie
as soon as he saw the baffled expression on Nan&rsquo;s
face, jumped immediately to the right conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might have known that would happen. Should
have taken care of them all myself. Can&rsquo;t depend
on women and girls. Always tell Alice that. Ought
to have a safe place to keep things. Old pouch my
mother used to strap around her waist was a good
idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan couldn&rsquo;t restrain the smile that came to
her eyes at this. She had known one person in her
life who tied a bag around her waist. That was
grim old Mrs. Cupp, assistant to Dr. Beulah
Prescott, principal at Lakeview Hall. Legend had
it that Mrs. Cupp had a dark secret the key to
which she carried in the black bag which someone,
in days long before Nan and Bess descended on
Lakeview Hall, had seen. Whether or not it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
so, Nan didn&rsquo;t know, but at Lakeview Hall, the
words &ldquo;Keep it a secret&rdquo; were generally expressed
by saying &ldquo;Put it in the black bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laughing at me, Miss!&rdquo; Adair&rsquo;s roar brought
Nan out of her reveries. She jumped, and looking
up into his face, she winged her way from Lakeview
Hall on the shores of the Great Lakes back
to Laredo, Texas and the immediate problem of
the lost visitor&rsquo;s pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said you should take care of your things the
way I do,&rdquo; he roared again. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he pushed
his hand inside his topcoat pocket, &ldquo;Always know
where my things&mdash;&rdquo; the end of the sentence was
lost in a sputter, as Adair MacKenzie searched
frantically in pocket after pocket for his visitor&rsquo;s
pass. It was gone!</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-w-why, somebody&rsquo;s picked my pockets.
Can&rsquo;t allow this. Where&rsquo;s a policeman? You, you,
why don&rsquo;t you do something instead of standing
there and laughing?&rdquo; Adair shook his cane at
Walker Jamieson who was grinning broadly at
the spectacle of the old man fuming and sputtering
now, not at his own negligence, but at the inefficiency
of a government that would allow such
things to happen. His tirade against Nan and her
carelessness were utterly forgotten.</p>

<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t necessary for Walker to do anything.
Adair, in his outburst, railing against governments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in general now, calling down the wrath
of the gods on the heads of all policemen, and
expressing himself most forcibly on the subject
of newspaper men in particular, attracted a crowd.
Shortly, English and Spanish words were being
flung this way and that and everyone was arguing,
but what it was all about no one seemed to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, daddy, what has happened?&rdquo; Alice having
heard the excitement from her seat in the office
where her father had left her had worked her way
through the crowd, and now put a restraining
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>Immediately, he was quiet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, dear,&rdquo;
he looked down at her shamefacedly, &ldquo;but these
blundering Mexicans have lost not only that poor
young girl&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he pointed to Nan with his cane,
&ldquo;visitor&rsquo;s pass, but mine too. It&rsquo;s an outrage!
That&rsquo;s what it is, an outrage. And I won&rsquo;t stand
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Walker,&rdquo; Alice turned to the young reporter
now, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss,&rdquo; the voice was that
of a Texas Ranger with a big ten-gallon hat who
had watched the whole scene with some amusement,
&ldquo;but if you&rsquo;ll step right over to the offices
there&rdquo; he nodded in the direction of the door
from which Alice had emerged a moment before,
&ldquo;Mr. Nogales will take care of you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Walker acknowledged the information,
grinned, as though he was sharing a joke
with the stranger, took both Alice and her father
by the arm, and, with Nan, worked his way out of
the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult problem.&rdquo; Lozario Nogales
gave a slight Spanish accent to his words as he
spoke to the Americans who, a few moments after
the scene above, were ushered into his office. &ldquo;You
see, it&rsquo;s like this&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke slowly and fingered
a pencil as he chose his words, for English did not
come any too easily to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! No difficulties at all.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
was always impatient with slow speech,
&ldquo;all you have to do is write out another of those
cards for each of us. Take you a minute. They&rsquo;re
nothing but a lot of silly red tape anyway. If I
had my way about it, there would be no passports,
no customs, no visitors&rsquo; passes, no anything that
impedes free movement of people across the borders.
It&rsquo;s all foolishness the way you Mexicans do
these things.&rdquo; Thus, with utter inconsistency,
Adair MacKenzie, in a moment&rsquo;s time placed the
whole burden of border regulations in the laps of
the Mexicans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Señor,&rdquo; Lozario felt that he never would
become accustomed to the ways of these Americans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and of this American in particular, &ldquo;there
are the rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rules! What rules?&rdquo; Adair stormed further,
then he caught Alice&rsquo;s eye and capitulated, &ldquo;Well,
what are we to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply this,&rdquo; Mr. Nogales was more than
grateful for Alice&rsquo;s presence which gave him at
last an opportunity to speak, &ldquo;there has been a
good deal of smuggling across the borders in the
past few months, and your American government
has made new rules about the issuing of duplicates
when passes are lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smuggling?&rdquo; Walker Jamieson now spoke up
for the first time since the party entered the office.
&ldquo;Smuggling what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the American gentleman knows that immigration
laws prohibit the free passage of certain
nationalities into the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker nodded. His work in San Francisco had
brought this fact most forcibly to his mind again
and again, for there he had worked often among
the Chinese and the Japanese and numbered
among them many close friends. These people
admired him and respected him greatly. They
thought that because he was a newspaper man, he
could do anything in the world for them that he
wanted to do.</p>

<p>As a consequence, they were constantly coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to him with tales of wives or mothers or children
that they wanted to see, but could not get into the
United States because of the immigration laws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the señor knows that these people somehow
or other manage to get across the border in
spite of these laws?&rdquo; Mr. Nogales continued. He
liked this young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Walker knew that too. Often he had
been amazed while covering his beat in Chinatown
to meet the very mothers, wives, or children
he had been asked to &ldquo;get here for me, please,
Mr. Jamieson&rdquo; a few days after being asked.</p>

<p>However, as he threaded through the dark
streets of the famous San Francisco Chinatown
this surprise always wore off. The ways of the
people he was among were so silent and mysterious,
even to him working among them and calling
them &ldquo;friends&rdquo;, that he had grown to take such
sudden appearances for granted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just lately,&rdquo; Mr. Nogales went on,
&ldquo;there have been even more than the usual number
of persons smuggled across. Your government
and mine has been working hard on the problem
of putting an end to this. One means of stopping
it has been to check most thoroughly the issuance
of all duplicate visitor&rsquo;s passes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was beginning to see light in the whole situation
now. Immigration laws and the smuggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of aliens across the border was something she had
studied about in social science classes at Lakeview.
This scene in the Laredo offices was a school lesson
brought to life.</p>

<p>Nan vaguely remembered, as she stood there
listening and watching, that Laura had once had
a special report to give on this particular subject.
She remembered because it was at the time the
girls were planning a big spread down at the boathouse,
and Laura had been so excited about the
whole thing that she had gone to class utterly unprepared.
In the few minutes before the assembly
bell rang Nan helped her out, and so Laura had
managed to struggle through the social science
hour.</p>

<p>Nan turned. She wished that Laura and the rest
were here now, but she knew that they were waiting
in an outer office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you think,&rdquo; Walker Jamieson&rsquo;s words
brought Nan back to the present plight of herself
and her cousin Adair, &ldquo;that there is a regular
trade in visitors&rsquo; passes, that the pickpocket who
got ours wanted nothing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had no money stolen, did you?&rdquo; Mr. Nogales
queried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh-h-h-&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie had been silent
for a long while for him. Now he rummaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
through his pockets even as Nan checked on the
contents of her purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; Mr. Nogales nodded his
head, as the two agreed that all their money was
there. &ldquo;Your visitors&rsquo; passes are the only thing
missing. Just a moment, please, I&rsquo;ll see what can
be done.&rdquo; With this, he disappeared into the office
of his superior, and Adair MacKenzie followed
him.</p>

<p>Nan, Alice, and Walker Jamieson looked hopelessly
at one another as Adair disappeared from
their view.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>TELL US ABOUT THE HACIENDA</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo; Laura inquired afterwards
when the girls were all settled in a hotel
close to the border for the night. &ldquo;That the walls
of that inner office would just cave in when Mr.
MacKenzie started bellowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Laura Polk, how disrespectfully you
talk!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed from her place in front of
the dressing table where she was brushing her
hair. &ldquo;And Mr. MacKenzie is our host too. If it
weren&rsquo;t for him we wouldn&rsquo;t be down here now.
At this minute we&rsquo;d probably be on the shores of
a lake near Tillbury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, you know I&rsquo;m not one bit disrespectful,
really,&rdquo; Laura retorted. &ldquo;I like Mr. MacKenzie
real well and you know I do. I&rsquo;d give anything
in the world to be able to roar the way he does.&rdquo;
There was genuine longing in her voice as she
spoke. &ldquo;Just imagine,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how handy
that roar would have come in the night we routed
the ghost. I just think,&rdquo; she continued to play with
the idea of making use of Adair MacKenzie&rsquo;s
roar, &ldquo;how handy it would come in, if we were to
meet Linda Riggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we manage,&rdquo; she was lying prone on
the bed, and, as this new idea came to her, she
cupped her chin in her hands and looked off into
space, &ldquo;to have your cousin around sometime
when Linda Riggs was present. I&rsquo;d love to have
him analyze her the way he did us today. Such
fun!&rdquo; Laura&rsquo;s eyes danced merrily at the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then I&rsquo;d like to have her open her mouth
to protest,&rdquo; Laura continued, &ldquo;and have him roar
at her. Oh, I&rsquo;d give a million dollars, a trillion
dollars,&rdquo; she amended generously, &ldquo;to hear that
roar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and me too,&rdquo; Bess joined in. &ldquo;By the way,
have any of you heard anything about her lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; Nan answered, &ldquo;and I must say the
less I hear about her and the less I see of her, the
better. There was a rumor, you know, at school
that she was going to be allowed to come back
this fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Bess somehow always managed to
hear all the rumors, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t for the life of
me understand why Dr. Prescott would ever let
her reenter. Certainly, she&rsquo;s no credit to Lakeview
Hall, or to any school for that matter. If I were
a principal I wouldn&rsquo;t let her in my school. In
fact, if I got the chance at all, I&rsquo;d just slam the
door right in her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, do you ever sound as though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
meant it? Cousin Adair should hear you talk now.
He thinks that Laura has a temper. He should
hear you sometimes.&rdquo; Nan laughed at her pal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I think I&rsquo;m more than justified.
She&rsquo;s certainly caused us plenty of trouble from
the very first time we ever met her. I&rsquo;ll never forget
how she embarrassed us on the train that took
us to Lakeview the first time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor how Professor Krenner took our part,&rdquo;
Nan added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor how you outwitted her and drove up to
school in the back of Walter Mason&rsquo;s car as
though you were a princess returning to her palace,&rdquo;
Laura giggled. &ldquo;There never was a freshman
created more of a stir than you did that
night. Boy, did we ever put our heads together in
corridor four and decide that we would have to
put you in your place right away,&rdquo; she continued
slangily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did I ever hate you, Laura Polk,&rdquo; Bess
laughed now at the recollection. &ldquo;You embarrassed
me so about that lunch box that when I
went to bed that night I cried myself to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Bessie,&rdquo; Laura sympathized. &ldquo;You were
such a proud little thing that I never in the world
thought I&rsquo;d ever be able to get along with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get along with Bess!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;if
you had ever heard what Bess said about you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
night, you would have been surprised that she
ever spoke to you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Bess?&rdquo; Laura looked positively
impish as she looked at Bess&rsquo;s reflection in
the mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; Bess was obviously
concealing the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do too,&rdquo; Amelia joined in as she wound
the pretty little travelling clock that had been
given her the week before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell, I will,&rdquo; Nan was enjoying
the situation as much as the rest, for she saw that
Bess was not really embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead then and see if I care,&rdquo; Bess retorted,
giving a few final strokes to her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you said,&rdquo; Nan began slowly, &ldquo;that that
homely red-headed Polk girl was just as mean as
she could be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say that?&rdquo; Laura laughed heartily.
Even in those days she would have been the first
to laugh at herself. Now she could laugh doubly,
for the homely red-headed girl had, since then,
blossomed out into a pretty, fair complexioned
curly headed miss with a very pleasing personality.</p>

<p>And so the girls continued for some time to
talk over events and happenings that are recounted
in other books of this series until Laura
turned to Nan, &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
return to the present and Laredo, Texas, will you
please tell us just how your cousin managed to
extract those passes from the authorities this afternoon?
I respected his abilities to get what he
wanted from the moment mother capitulated and
let me come down here with what she called, &lsquo;a
perfect stranger,&rsquo; but I never respected them as
much as I did when I saw that white uniformed
official bowing you people out of that office as
though you were the President&rsquo;s party itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he just grand!&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s eyes were alight
at the recollection. &ldquo;That man was none other
than a special aid to the Mexican consular office
here in Laredo, and he nearly fell all over trying
to help us after cousin Adair ceased his storming
and told those people who he was. I never saw
anything like it in my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was &lsquo;Si, señor, this,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Si, señor, that&rsquo;
until Alice and Walker and I began to think that
we were really somebody, if only by reflected
glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly looked like somebody very
important when you came out,&rdquo; Bess agreed. &ldquo;I
wondered for a moment whether I had really
heard allright when you went in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you did hear us?&rdquo; Nan laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All Mexico did,&rdquo; Laura put in. &ldquo;Really, at
first we thought another revolution was taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
place. Grace here was looking around for someplace
to hide herself. Amelia was clutching her
watch to her with a look of determination which
said as plainly as anything &lsquo;no foraging rebel is
going to get this&rsquo; and Rhoda looked as though
she wished she had brought her trusty six shooter
along. And then when we had gotten ourselves all
worked up to the point of accepting the inevitable,
who should come round the corner but you and
Mr. Jamieson, Alice and her father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound as though we disappointed you,&rdquo;
Nan remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all.&rdquo; Laura hastened to correct
this impression. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. MacKenzie
has ever disappointed anyone in his life. He just
couldn&rsquo;t. Not with that cane, that roar, and that
honesty which stops at nothing. He&rsquo;s a dear. Now
tell us, Nan, all you know about this place we are
going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done that a thousand times since I met
you in St. Louis,&rdquo; Nan responded as she pulled
off her dress and slipped her arms into the lounging
robe that the Lakeview Hall girls had given
her at a surprise party in her honor more than a
year before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura denied. &ldquo;We
made you spend most of the time telling us about
this angel of a cousin that appeared out of a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sky and offered to take us all to Mexico. Doesn&rsquo;t
sound real even now when we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing about it,&rdquo; Amelia added, &ldquo;if
one can&rsquo;t have rich relations oneself, the next best
thing in the world is to have charming friends who
have them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo; Laura raised a protesting hand.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of order. The first thing you know
Nan will be thinking we&rsquo;re fond of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you old ducks,&rdquo; Nan looked at them all
fondly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that cousin Adair knew
that if he didn&rsquo;t invite all of you that I wouldn&rsquo;t
come at all? Now, let&rsquo;s forget all of this gratitude
stuff. It embarrasses me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; Bess agreed, &ldquo;but you really
haven&rsquo;t told Rhoda anything at all about the
hacienda, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything myself,&rdquo; Nan admitted
after some hesitation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried and tried to get
cousin Adair to tell me something about the place,
but he just won&rsquo;t say anything. I&rsquo;m not sure whether
he knows and won&rsquo;t tell or whether he doesn&rsquo;t
know himself. At any rate, he&rsquo;s being extremely
mysterious about the whole thing. Says that we
didn&rsquo;t see anything when we saw Emberon, that
this place that we are going has that beat all
hollow. Now what do you people make of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dungeons, secret passage, weird wailing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
bagpipes, that&rsquo;s what Emberon had,&rdquo; Laura summarized.
&ldquo;If this Mexican hacienda has anything
better to offer, I&rsquo;d like to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so would I,&rdquo; Nan agreed. She almost
resented the idea that anything could possibly be
any nicer than the old Blake estate in Scotland.
&ldquo;And listen, he says this further, that if we think
we had adventures in Scotland and England, we
just haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet. What in the world
do you suppose he means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Doctor Prescott said that, or Mrs. Cupp,
or your father or mine,&rdquo; Rhoda answered, &ldquo;I
might possibly hazard a guess as to what was
meant, but there&rsquo;s no telling about this cousin of
yours, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s as unpredictable as the seasons, Alice
says, and the only thing we can do is wait.&rdquo; Nan
sounded as though waiting was the hardest thing
in the world to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT MEXICO</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Laura questioned the next
morning when she came upon Amelia in her hotel
room reading diligently from a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo; Amelia barely looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, tell aunty,&rdquo; Laura teased. &ldquo;Nobody
else is up yet and I&rsquo;ve simply got to talk to
someone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean there&rsquo;s no one else about, so you&rsquo;ll
talk to me. Well, I like that!&rdquo; Amelia returned to
her book as though she were really indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura sounded very conciliatory&mdash;for
her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this; I&rsquo;ve got the
whim-whams something terrible. Did you ever
have the whim-whams, Amelia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I did,&rdquo; Amelia answered. &ldquo;At least
I didn&rsquo;t call them any such name as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you know what I mean?&rdquo; Laura looked
very serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; Amelia turned the open book
over on her lap and answered Laura&rsquo;s question,
&ldquo;that you have awakened early in a hotel in a
strange city, that you want like anything to go off
exploring, that you know you can&rsquo;t, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
next best thing you can find to do is to annoy
someone else who can&rsquo;t go either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear professor,&rdquo; Laura assumed as serious
a mien as possible, &ldquo;you have hit the well-known
nail squarely on the head. It must be that
you have the whim-whams too. Now what is that
you are reading?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know,&rdquo; Amelia gave in,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a guidebook to Mexico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, what could be better.&rdquo; Laura herself
reached for the book. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what this country
across the street from this hotel is like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem funny, doesn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; Amelia said,
&ldquo;that when we look out our hotel windows we are
looking into a foreign country. It doesn&rsquo;t look any
different. It doesn&rsquo;t sound any different. And it
doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smell any different,&rdquo; Laura finished, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s the most surprising thing of all, because according
to Mr. MacKenzie, Mexico is just the
smelliest place on God&rsquo;s green earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you that too?&rdquo; Amelia asked.
&ldquo;Really, when he finished the tirade against the
country that he delivered to me after dinner, I
began to wonder why in the world he ever
brought along five such nice girls as we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five? What&rsquo;s the matter, &rsquo;Mealy, can&rsquo;t you
count before breakfast? There are six of us.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I said five <em>nice</em> girls,&rdquo; Amelia insisted. &ldquo;He
might have had one of several reasons for bringing
you along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as&mdash;&rdquo; Nan had come into the room just
in time to hear this last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he might have wanted to make the world
a better place for the rest of us to live in by losing
Laura, making her a target for the revolutionists,
feeding her to the bulls, or just leaving her here
as food for the fleas,&rdquo; Amelia responded airily,
and then she put her arm around Laura&rsquo;s shoulder
as though to show her that she didn&rsquo;t mean a
word of what she was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do say,&rdquo; Grace added as she joined the
group, &ldquo;that the fleas here are man-sized. That
reporter told me last night that the reason they
give us mosquito netting to put over us at night
is that the fleas and the mosquitos wage a nightly
battle as to who is going to carry off the
Americans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you believed him?&rdquo; Laura laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; Grace answered, &ldquo;but I
did carefully tuck my netting all round me last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me lots of things about Mexico, too,&rdquo;
Nan added, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know which of them to
believe. This is a queer country we are going into,
full of so many strange legends, so many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
kinds of people that any wild tale at all might be
true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking,&rdquo; Amelia agreed,
&ldquo;when Laura came into the room this morning.
This guidebook here is full of all sorts of queer
tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as&mdash;?&rdquo; Nan queried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you people in there,&rdquo; Bess called from
another room, &ldquo;wait until Rhoda and I come before
you talk any more about Mexico. We want
to hear too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, slow-pokes,&rdquo; Nan called back,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to hurry. We&rsquo;re supposed to be
downstairs for breakfast with Cousin Adair in
exactly one-half hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, Bess and Rhoda came into Amelia&rsquo;s
room and the girls, all dressed in sports clothes,
settled themselves to learn something about the
country they were going to visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It says here,&rdquo; Nan began, for she had long
ago lifted the guidebook from Amelia&rsquo;s lap, &ldquo;that
Mexico is a Latin-American country south of the
United States of America. The Gulf of Mexico
is to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know that,&rdquo; Bess interrupted impatiently,
&ldquo;tell us something that is different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Nan queried, &ldquo;Mexico is
a land of great contrasts. About sixty percent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
its population are Indians who live in a backward
civilization that weaves its own clothes, grinds
its own corn, does everything for itself by hand.
The other forty percent is advanced and modern.
The first can neither read nor write. The latter
attends modern schools and universities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in Mexico, in its history, its climate,
its people, or its landscape is dull or
monotonous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Bess approved. She was not
one to care much for facts or figures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are more interesting things than
that in the book,&rdquo; Amelia reached for it. &ldquo;Here
let me read you something that I found this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a second,&rdquo; Nan held on to it, &ldquo;How in
the world do you pronounce these words with all
their z&rsquo;s and x&rsquo;s. No wonder there are so many
people that can&rsquo;t read or write. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able
to write myself if I lived here. Imagine living in
a place called I&nbsp;x&nbsp;m&nbsp;i&nbsp;q&nbsp;u&nbsp;i&nbsp;l&nbsp;p&nbsp;a&nbsp;n or X&nbsp;o&nbsp;c&nbsp;h&nbsp;i&nbsp;m&nbsp;i&nbsp;l&nbsp;c&nbsp;o.&rdquo;
She spelled them all out because she
couldn&rsquo;t possibly pronounce them. &ldquo;They must all
be Indian words dating from the time of the Aztecs,&rdquo;
Nan went on. &ldquo;Look, they all have beautiful
meanings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chalchihuites is translated into &lsquo;Emeralds in
the Rough&rsquo;, Tehuacan, &lsquo;Stone of the gods&rsquo;, Chiapas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
&lsquo;River of the Lime-leaved Sage&rsquo;, and Tzintzuntzan,
&lsquo;Humming Bird&rsquo;. And here&rsquo;s a place I
want to go, Yecapixtla or &lsquo;Place Where People
Have Sharp Noses&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a funny place that must be,&rdquo; Laura
laughed with Nan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they all spend their
time minding one another&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They probably have a factory there,&rdquo; Nan
went on, &ldquo;for turning out people like Mrs. Cupp
and they have catalogues showing the sharp,
sharper, and sharpest noses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when a school principal wants to hire an
assistant that will see everything and hear everything
he pays top price and gets the sharpest,&rdquo;
Laura liked the idea. &ldquo;We ought to go there,&rdquo;
she ended, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s only to get a postcard so that
we can send it back to Mrs. Cupp with the words
&lsquo;Wish you were here&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura, you old meany,&rdquo; Nan laughed.
&ldquo;You know she isn&rsquo;t half as bad as you make her
out to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura agreed. &ldquo;Lakeview Hall
certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without her. Why,
down here in Mexico&mdash;well, on the border of
Mexico&mdash;when I&rsquo;m going farther and farther
away from her all the time, I can almost believe
that I&rsquo;m fond of her. But don&rsquo;t let me talk about
it,&rdquo; she pretended to sniff as though she was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to cry, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll be getting homesick for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Small chance of your ever getting homesick
for anyone,&rdquo; Bess remarked, &ldquo;but let&rsquo;s hear what
it is Amelia wants to tell us about and then go
downstairs, I&rsquo;m almost starved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, Amelia,&rdquo; Nan handed over the
book, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to monopolize it.&rdquo; These
Lakeview Hall girls, together for so many years
under all sorts of circumstances, were still polite
to one another and thoughtful about little things.
They teased one another, laughed at one another&rsquo;s
faults, and quarreled sometimes among themselves,
but they were always eager to forgive and
more than anxious to please. This was why they
had been friends for so long. They were never
really jealous of one another and were always
ready to praise anyone in the group who did anything
outstanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Nan,&rdquo; Amelia answered as she
reached for the book. &ldquo;I merely thought that this
story of the founding of Mexico City might be
fun to read. It&rsquo;s short, Bess, so we&rsquo;ll be downstairs
in just a few minutes. Here it is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the Aztecs, a people that inhabited
this part of Mexico long before the coming of the
white man from across the water, were wandering
from place to place in search of a spot on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to establish themselves, their head priest had a
vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In it, he saw their War God and heard him
telling them to go on and on until they found an
eagle on a cactus growing from the rock. The
cactus, the War God said, was the heart of his
treacherous nephew who had waged war against
him and lost. As punishment, he had been put to
death and his heart was torn from him and thrown
into the lake. It fell upon a rock among the reeds,
and from it grew a cactus so big and strong that
an eagle, seeking a place to build his nest, had
made his home upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Aztecs heeded the words of their War
God as told them by the priest. For years they
wandered, until finally, one morning very early,
their long search was rewarded. They came upon
the eagle on the cactus! His wings were extended
to the rays of the sun and in his claws he held a
snake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So it was here that they built their city and
even to this day, the cactus and the eagle, holding
a snake in his beak, is Mexico&rsquo;s emblem.&rsquo;&rdquo; With
this, Amelia closed the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been seeing that symbol on
so many Mexican things all these years,&rdquo; Nan
commented. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered what it meant, but
was always too lazy to look it up. How strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the history of this country is that we are going
into! I wonder what will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably everything,&rdquo; Laura said, &ldquo;so, now I
think we&rsquo;d better go downstairs and eat, fortify
ourselves so to speak for any emergency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Nan laughed. And with
this, Nan and her friends all hurried down to
breakfast and to the beginning of another day in
their Mexican adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>BESS SMELLS A ROMANCE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well, how are the charming señoritas this
morning?&rdquo; Walker Jamieson dropped his feet
from the chair next to him and rose as Nan and
her friends entered the lounge of the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, one, two, three, four, five, yes, there
are six of you still. There was no victory for the
mosquitoes last night I can see. I had an idea,&rdquo; he
nodded his head slowly as though he had been
seriously considering the subject, &ldquo;that all would
go well after my joust with the man-sized monster
that forced its way into my room. Boy, was it a big
one! It had a million legs like tentacles that
wound themselves around me so that if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for my trusty Excalibur, none of us would
have been here this morning. It was a fight.&rdquo; He
shook his head as though the recollection was
more than he could bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can see it was.&rdquo; Alice, too, had been
waiting for the girls to appear. &ldquo;We can see the
marks of the bloody battle all over your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you really?&rdquo; Walker Jamieson grinned
down at the girl who was just a foot shorter than
himself. &ldquo;Well, they are all for you ladies,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pretended now to doff a big sombrero and sweep
it across in front of him in the most approved
style.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this nonsense?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
joined the party. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand silliness any time,
and least of all before breakfast. Now, get out
into that dining room and eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the whole party moved. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t intend
to spend the summer in Laredo,&rdquo; Adair muttered
as he followed them.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a silent meal&mdash;silent that is, save
for Adair&rsquo;s sputtering into his coffee. At its finish,
he pushed his plate back, called the waiter and
gave him an extraordinarily large tip, and turned
to his young cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Nancy,&rdquo; he said agreeably, &ldquo;How are
things with you this fine morning? Ready to move
on? And you, Bess, and all the rest of you, are
you all right? Now, let me tell you all a secret,&rdquo;
he went on as he realized how quiet everyone had
been throughout the meal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really such a
bad old soul. Oh, I lose my temper at times. I
admit that,&rdquo; he said generously, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not bad,
not bad at all.&rdquo; He shook his head as though he
was entirely satisfied with himself and the world
in general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you there, Jamieson, you&rsquo;re not bad
either,&rdquo; he went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Walker nodded his head as though he acquiesced
entirely and Alice beamed on everyone. It was
nice to have everyone in such a happy frame of
mind, she thought, and then, for luck, crossed her
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, daddy,&rdquo; she ventured while he was
still in his expansive mood, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on the program
for today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots of things, lots of nice things,&rdquo; he
looked very pleased with himself. &ldquo;First off, how
soon can you all be ready to move on? We should
be moving along to Mexico City, a grand place,
one of the most interesting cities I&rsquo;ve ever visited.
What say you, Jamieson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; Jamieson had been quite bowled
over by the old man&rsquo;s sudden change in mood and
had been wondering whether it would be the right
time now to ask whether he could kidnap Alice
for part of the morning. He was trying to signal
her to ask her opinion, when the question was addressed
to him. Now, he was at a complete loss,
for he had heard nothing of the conversation that
preceded the query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Adair repeated his question patiently,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t Mexico City a grand place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, a grand place,&rdquo; Walker answered absently.
Had Alice understood what he was signaling?
He couldn&rsquo;t be sure. What was she telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
him with her lips. Was it &ldquo;Better wait&rdquo; or &ldquo;Better
not.&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; The question came out audibly
without his realizing it.</p>

<p>It was Nan, the darling, who saved the day.
She had been watching the frantic efforts of
Walker Jamieson to communicate with Alice and
noted his lack of success. She, too, had been trying
to read Alice&rsquo;s answer and was as startled as
Walker when his &ldquo;what?&rdquo; was voiced. Now, like
a &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; (Walker used the word later when
he promised to buy her something, anything from
a gorgeously colored serape to an jade bracelet
for coming to his rescue) she filled the breach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; she affirmed, looking at Walker as
though she was answering his question, &ldquo;that we
can all be ready to leave about noon, if it pleases
cousin Adair.&rdquo; She turned to her cousin somewhat
diffidently as she added this last. The truth was,
of course, that she and her friends could have left
in an hour, in a half hour, but it was fun trying to
help Walker and Alice out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; Adair took out his big gold watch
and considered. &ldquo;Noon. That gives us a few hours
to make a good start on our way before dark.
Could you make it by eleven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looked at Walker. &ldquo;Eleven-thirty.&rdquo; She
read his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleven-thirty,&rdquo; she smiled up at her cousin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You little beggar, you,&rdquo; he tweaked the pink
ear that showed just beneath her brown bobbed
hair, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be able to barter with those Mexicans
like a veteran. It&rsquo;s your Scotch blood.&rdquo; He looked
proud of her as he turned to the others, &ldquo;Well,
Nan here says &lsquo;eleven-thirty&rsquo;, so eleven-thirty it
is. Now get out, all of you, I&rsquo;ve got some business
to attend to, and I don&rsquo;t want to see any more of
any of you until it&rsquo;s time to leave. No, not even
you,&rdquo; he added as he looked at Alice.</p>

<p>They all strolled out of the dining room together
and Walker executed a few fancy little
steps for Nan&rsquo;s benefit, as, when they reached the
elevators, he and Alice went on past them to the
doors and out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan Sherwood, it&rsquo;s a romance. Walker
Jamieson is in love with Alice MacKenzie. I&rsquo;ll bet
you anything.&rdquo; Bess&rsquo;s face was all alight as she
closed the door of Nan&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just thrilling.
Did you see the way the two of them walked away
together. Why, they were so glad you said you
couldn&rsquo;t be ready until eleven-thirty! I just know
they were!&rdquo; Bess was fairly bubbling over with
excitement. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see it at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; Nan pretended innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how glad they were, of course,&rdquo; Bess
seemed impatient with Nan&rsquo;s inability to see a romance
when it was right under her nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, you imagine things,&rdquo; Nan answered.
She didn&rsquo;t want Bess to be aware at all that she
had tried to help Alice and Walker out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine things! You&rsquo;re just blind, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
Bess was very proud of her discovery. &ldquo;They are
in love with one another and they&rsquo;ll get married
in Mexico. You&rsquo;ll be the maid of honor and we&rsquo;ll
be the bridesmaids and everything will be just
grand, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, Bess,&rdquo; Nan laughed, &ldquo;how you do jump
to conclusions! Have you ever considered that the
bride has to have someone to give her away and
have you tried to imagine cousin Adair giving
Alice away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was all soberness immediately. &ldquo;No, I
didn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Oh, what
can we do about him?&rdquo; she puckered her brows as
if Adair was an immediate and very difficult problem.
&ldquo;If we could get him right after he has had
a good breakfast,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;maybe he would
be as nice as he was this morning and then I&rsquo;m
sure everything would be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; she continued, as a new and better idea
came to her, &ldquo;they could elope. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be
exciting, Nan? And just think how mad your cousin
would be. No, that&rsquo;s not so good either. Mr.
MacKenzie would probably disown Alice and then
they wouldn&rsquo;t have all his money.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;how you do run on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Bess agreed, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s such a
perfectly entrancing subject. She&rsquo;s a darling and
so is he. Why, he&rsquo;s almost as nice as Walter
Mason,&rdquo; she added slyly.</p>

<p>Nan ignored this last. &ldquo;Walker is nice, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And he and Alice do look dear
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s swell,&rdquo; Bess said slangily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tall and
handsome and full of fun. Do you know, I think
sometimes that Mr. MacKenzie does like him,
for all the way he calls him &lsquo;lazy&rsquo; and a &lsquo;no-good
reporter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he does,&rdquo; Nan agreed, &ldquo;and Walker
likes him too. I just know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess looked at Nan questioningly at this latter
bit of information. Did Nan know something she
didn&rsquo;t know?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see what
happens,&rdquo; Nan tried to dismiss the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Bess sighed, &ldquo;but it would be
such fun to be an attendant at a wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bessie,&rdquo; Nan ruffled her friend&rsquo;s hair,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re such a romantic soul. I&rsquo;ll bet that you
think that if worse came to worse and cousin
Adair insisted that Alice marry someone else,
Walker would ride up on a charger and carry
Alice off the way young Lochinvar did in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
poem we learned back in the fifth grade.
Remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the one about Lochinvar coming up
out of the West, &lsquo;through all the wide world his
steed was the best,&rsquo;&rdquo; Bess laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; Nan assented. &ldquo;Remember
how we loved that thing and how we used to
say over and over again the stanza that followed
the one where he asked the bride to dance with
him</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they reach&rsquo;d the hall door, and the charger
stood near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light to the saddle before her he sprung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and
scaur;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They&rsquo;ll have fleet steeds that follow, quoth young
Lochinvar.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;And then at the end,&rdquo; Bess went on, &ldquo;there was
this,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;There was racing and chasing, on Cannobie lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lost bride of Netherby ne&rsquo;er did they see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ye e&rsquo;er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan,&rdquo; Bess laughed when she had finished,
&ldquo;when I was a kid I thought there couldn&rsquo;t
possibly be anything more romantic than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I neither,&rdquo; Nan admitted, &ldquo;And I
thought of it often when we were in Scotland last
summer. But do you know, Bess,&rdquo; she giggled,
&ldquo;that Young Lochinvar of today would have to
dash up in a car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or in Mexico it might be a burro,&rdquo; Bess
laughed heartily at the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you two making such a rumpus
about,&rdquo; Laura stuck her head in through the door.
&ldquo;First thing you know, they&rsquo;ll be locking you up
as a couple of laughing hyenas, because you are
making such a racket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Laura,&rdquo; Nan invited, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
just got a silly streak, that&rsquo;s all. Bess, here, had
a couple of crazy ideas that she aired. She&rsquo;s all
right now. You can come in,&rdquo; she finished reassuringly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Laura answered in such an unusual
tone that Nan knew immediately something
was wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, what is it?&rdquo; she asked again, going
over to Laura and closing the door behind her.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>TROUBLE FOR RHODA</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Rhoda,&rdquo; Laura admitted when the
door was closed. &ldquo;Nan, something terrible&rsquo;s happened
and Rhoda is in her room crying her eyes
out. Won&rsquo;t you come and see if you can&rsquo;t do something
for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Nan started for the door at once.
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; She and Bess asked this
last together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhoda just received a telegram from her father
asking her to come home at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls,&rdquo; Laura herself was almost in tears,
&ldquo;Rhoda&rsquo;s mother is seriously ill and they don&rsquo;t
know whether or not she will live until Rhoda gets
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go downstairs,&rdquo; Nan took command of the
situation at once, &ldquo;and find cousin Adair. Tell him
what&rsquo;s happened and ask him what to do. I&rsquo;ll go
to Rhoda. Bess, you had better come too,&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;Somebody will have to fix her bags so
that she can leave at once. Now, don&rsquo;t any of you
cry in front of Rhoda, we&rsquo;ve got to help her to be
as brave as possible. Maybe it isn&rsquo;t as bad as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it seems.&rdquo; With this Nan and Bess and Laura set
about to help their friend and, for the time, all
thoughts of their Mexican journey were forgotten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond, Rhoda&rsquo;s mother, had entertained
the girls a couple of years previous to the
present story, on the Hammond ranch in the
West. They all remembered her as a beautifully
graceful, sweet woman. Blind for many years, she
had not let her affliction crush her spirit and was,
perhaps, one of the happiest, nicest people they
had ever known.</p>

<p>Those who have read &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Rose
Ranch or The Old Mexican&rsquo;s Treasure&rdquo; will remember
Mrs. Hammond too and remember well
her first meeting with the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget it,&rdquo; Nan had told her own
mother again and again. &ldquo;As we rode up to the
veranda of the low-roofed ranch house Mr. and
Mrs. Hammond stood there on the porch waiting
for us. She was a tall lovely person. I liked her the
moment I saw her. As I came up the steps behind
her friend, Mrs. Janeway, she took hold of me
and asked &lsquo;Who is this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I had a chance to answer she ran her
fingers lightly over my face, even feeling my ears
and the way my hair fluffed over my forehead and
the way my eyebrows were. Then, without any
hesitation and before I had said anything at all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
she said, &lsquo;Why, this is Nan Sherwood that I have
heard so much about.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I asked her how she knew, she laughed
the prettiest laugh I&rsquo;ve ever heard, outside of
yours, and said that she knew because Rhoda had
written home about me and because she was a
witch. She knew the others by touch too. Oh, she
was such a nice person and so good to us all the
while we were there!</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never once said a thing about her blindness.
She seemed to take it for granted and never
excused herself on account of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope that, if ever anything terrible
happens to me, I will remember her and be as
sweet and uncomplaining about it as she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other girls had felt the same as Nan. All
had left Rose Ranch with a very warm feeling
for Mrs. Hammond and they were all better girls
for having met her.</p>

<p>In the days that followed their return to school
that year they sent her a gift along with their
bread-and-butter notes. Ever after that, boxes
Rhoda received from her Western home always
contained some sort of goodies specially marked
for Rhoda&rsquo;s Lakeview Hall friends. So Mrs.
Hammond had become a well-beloved friend to
them all.</p>

<p>Now, when the telegram came telling of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
serious illness, they all felt personally concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan,&rdquo; Laura came into the room where
Nan was helping Rhoda dress and comforting her
as much as possible, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find your cousin anyplace.
He seems to have gone out on business and
he didn&rsquo;t leave word with anyone as to where he
was going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to find him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Nan
was not one to give up easily in any circumstances.
&ldquo;Have you tried to locate Walker Jamieson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I can&rsquo;t find him or Alice either. You
don&rsquo;t know where they were going, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Already Nan was regretting that she
had helped Alice and Walker out. She felt that
she needed them now, very much. &ldquo;I tell you what
you do, you call up the railway station and find out
what are the best possible train connections that
Rhoda can make. Then reserve her a compartment.
After that call those offices where we were
yesterday and ask whether cousin Adair is there
or is expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the time you finish, Rhoda will be ready
and we&rsquo;ll be downstairs at the telegraph desk. We
are going to wire her father so that he can have
someone at the station to meet her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these instructions, Laura flew across the hall
to her own room to make the calls, for she wished
to keep things as quiet as possible around Rhoda.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
In the meantime, both Amelia and Grace had
heard what had happened and came to help.</p>

<p>The girls were all sticking together in trouble
even as they always did in pleasure, and it was a
great comfort to completely bewildered Rhoda.</p>

<p>Now, as Nan completed the job of helping
Rhoda dress and Bess finished packing her bags,
there was a gentle knock on the door and a gentle
voice inquired, &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; It was Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walker&rsquo;s gone for father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;And
Laura&rsquo;s asked me to tell you that there&rsquo;s a train
out in a half hour. Is everything ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhoda nodded her head, but said nothing. She
was trying hard now not to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you know where cousin Adair is?&rdquo; Nan
looked across the room at Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but Walker will find him and have him
here in no time at all,&rdquo; Alice replied quietly and
confidently.</p>

<p>She had hardly finished the sentence, when
those in the room heard the firm tread of Adair
MacKenzie in the hall and heard his voice boom
out, &ldquo;Porter, porter, come here, and take these
bags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was good to hear him, good to hear his decisiveness.
Everyone in the room felt better as
soon as he opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, here, what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; He looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Rhoda&rsquo;s red eyes. &ldquo;Come, girl, buck up,&rdquo; he
patted her roughly on the shoulder. &ldquo;Ready, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going by plane. It leaves in fifteen minutes
and there&rsquo;s a taxi waiting downstairs. That
red-headed girl, what&rsquo;s her name, got you a compartment
in a train, but we&rsquo;ve cancelled that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that good-for-nothing newspaper friend
of my daughter&rsquo;s is downstairs putting through a
long distance call so that you can talk to your
father before you leave here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can tell him that this is a private plane
and that it will practically drop you in your own
back yard. Do they have back yards where you
come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhoda nodded. How good everyone was being
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, now, don&rsquo;t thank me,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
forestalled her thanks. &ldquo;Help a nice girl like
you out any time I can. Ready? You better go
downstairs. You&rsquo;ve just got time to talk to your
father before you make the plane. You&rsquo;ll find
everything comfortable there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, you, Nan,&rdquo; he motioned to his cousin,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one that can come along with us.
Don&rsquo;t want a lot of fuss. See the rest of you later.&rdquo;
With this, he hurried Nan and Rhoda out of the
room and down the elevator so quickly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Rhoda, in doing things, got control of herself,
just as Adair MacKenzie had known she would.</p>

<p>The talk with her father was comforting, but
not encouraging, and it was with a heavy, heavy
heart that Rhoda Hammond waved good-by to
her friends at the airport a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Nan stifled a sob as the plane taxied across the
field and rose into the air. Adair MacKenzie
looked down on her. &ldquo;There, there, child,&rdquo; he
said gently, &ldquo;Things will turn out all right and
we&rsquo;ll make this up to the girl sometime later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan caught her upper lip between her teeth and
tried to smile up at him. &ldquo;Please, please, make
everything right.&rdquo; It was a prayer that she
breathed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>RESOLUTIONS</small></h2>


<p>It was a sad little party that drew out of Laredo
that afternoon. The thoughts of Nan and her
friends were all with Rhoda. At every turn they
wondered where she was and what she was doing.</p>

<p>Only Adair MacKenzie&rsquo;s insistence had made
them depart from the city on the border at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got to be on our way now,&rdquo; he had said
brusquely when he and Nan had driven up to the
hotel after seeing Rhoda off. &ldquo;Now, get busy,
you,&rdquo; he ordered the girls after they had heard
the details of Rhoda&rsquo;s departure from Nan.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stay around here any longer. Sick and tired
of this place. Nothing but a hole in the wall. Don&rsquo;t
like it. Don&rsquo;t like the people. We&rsquo;re leaving. Get
busy, I say.&rdquo; He tapped his cane impatiently on
the floor of the hotel veranda. &ldquo;I mean you and
you and you.&rdquo; He pointed with it to each separate
member of the party.</p>

<p>The girls jumped. Alice jumped. And Walker
Jamieson jumped. Everyone got busy and in an
hour&rsquo;s time they were all sitting on the veranda,
dressed for traveling, waiting for the car to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
appeared in the doorway. Short and somewhat
stocky with a face that was perpetually tanned
and dressed as he was in a white suit and large
white panama hat, he looked like a permanent
part of the scene about him. Nan, as she looked at
him felt proud. Despite all his blustering, his
ordering of people around, and his abrupt manner,
he was kind and gentle at heart. This, she
knew, was the reason for his success. This was
why everyone who had ever known him liked him
and loved him.</p>

<p>Now, characteristically, he followed his abrupt
question with a piece of information that laid
bare his softness and unfailing thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get inside, all of you,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;there are
long distance calls coming through for each of you
from your parents. Can&rsquo;t have you mooning
around,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;waiting for mail in order
to find out whether or not your mothers and fathers
are well. You, Nancy, your call is waiting
now. Just talked to Jessie myself in Memphis.
She&rsquo;s fine, just fine. Never felt better in her life
she says. Might have known it in the first place.
The Blakes are strong people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, he walked away. &ldquo;No nonsense,
now,&rdquo; he grumbled as he disappeared and each of
the girls went in to talk from a telephone booth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
on the southern border of the United States to her
parents in the north.</p>

<p>How exciting it was to talk over that great distance!
How good it seemed to the girls to hear
their mother&rsquo;s voices! Nan talked to both her
father and mother in Tennessee, and as she did,
she imagined just how they looked, the expressions
on their faces when they said certain dear,
familiar things and the look in their eyes when
they laughed. It was almost like having them in
the same room with her.</p>

<p>As she hung up, a wistful expression crossed
her face, one that Adair MacKenzie, standing off
to one side of the room noted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,
Nancy?&rdquo; he asked in a softer tone than Nan
had ever heard him use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lonesome?&rdquo; Adair questioned further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little bit,&rdquo; Nan smiled. &ldquo;Sometimes, I
miss Momsey a great, great deal.&rdquo; As she spoke
her thoughts slipped back to those first days at
Pine Camp recounted in the first volume of the
Nan Sherwood series when it was so hard to fight
off the wave of homesickness that came over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not going to back down on me and go home,
are you?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie asked the question
half in fun and half in seriousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Nan laughed. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s cousin applauded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
&ldquo;Never back down on anything you set out to do.
When you start a thing, finish it. That&rsquo;s the way
people get places. Made me what I am. Never
started a thing yet I didn&rsquo;t finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looking at him, believed it. He had the air
about him of one that accomplishes things. You
could see it in the way he walked, the way he
talked. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;what it is, a school lesson, a vacation, a
housekeeping task for your mother. If you begin
it, finish it.&rdquo; He said this last so emphatically that
Nan looked about her half expecting to find something
that she should finish right away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;how hard the thing is or how much you want to
do something else. Do the thing you first started
and do it as well as you possibly can. Understand
what I mean?&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s cousin looked at her very
intently for a moment and then he ruffled her
pretty brown hair with his rough hand. &ldquo;Of course
you do, child,&rdquo; he smiled at her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bright
as they make them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dad, oh, dad!&rdquo; Alice MacKenzie joined the
two. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted. The car&rsquo;s ready and the
driver wants to know when we&rsquo;re going to start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Start!&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie, the soft mood having
slipped away from him now, roared. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
I been waiting around here for an hour now for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that old sluggard. And then he has the effrontery
to send word to me that he&rsquo;s waiting! The dolt!
I&rsquo;ll fix him. I&rsquo;ll fix him, if it&rsquo;s the last thing in the
world I do! Thinks I&rsquo;m a softy, does he? I&rsquo;ll show
him!&rdquo; With this, Adair MacKenzie went fuming
from the room.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Nan Sherwood and her
friends, Walker Jamieson, and Alice and her father
were riding along the road toward Mexico
City.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got this telegram just before we left,&rdquo; Adair
MacKenzie felt in his pockets for the yellow
paper, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from that Hammond girl.&rdquo; He turned
it over to Nan who read aloud to the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived safely at San Antonio. Plane there
ready to take me on. Called home again. Mother
holding her own. Love. Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s voice was husky as she finished. She
folded the telegram slowly and thoughtfully,
thinking of the struggle that was going on at Rose
Ranch and remembering her own concern years
back over her own mother&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Nan,&rdquo; Bess laid a gentle hand on her
friend&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so worried. I&rsquo;m sure things
will turn out for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, if they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nan half whispered
in return, &ldquo;It will leave Rhoda and her father all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
alone. It will make things so hard, for everyone
just worships Mrs. Hammond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Bess&rsquo;s voice was heavy too, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t think of those things.&rdquo; The role of consoler
was new to Bess, but instinctively she was saying
just the right thing. &ldquo;Mrs. Hammond just has to
get well, and so she will. I feel sure that what I&rsquo;m
saying is true. Oh, Nan, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; Bess&rsquo;s own
voice was full of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, here, what&rsquo;s happening back there?&rdquo;
Adair MacKenzie turned from his place next to
the driver and frowned at the girls. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have
this. No blubbering on this trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan smiled a wan smile at the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you were a brave girl,&rdquo; Adair went
on. &ldquo;Now, dry away those tears,&rdquo; he ended, and
turning, resumed his work of instructing the
driver as to how to drive.</p>

<p>It was Laura who unthinkingly started them all
off again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes you think, doesn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; she remarked,
&ldquo;of the number of things you overlook doing for
your mother when you&rsquo;re around her? Will I ever
be good,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;when I get home. I&rsquo;ll
wash the dishes, set the table, run to the store, do
anything and everything without question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura sounded so serious and so unlike herself
in her seriousness that even Nan had to smile, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
she agreed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way it makes me
feel,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan,&rdquo; Bess protested, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re always
so good to your mother. I&rsquo;m the one that&rsquo;s
mean. Why, I never do a thing around the house
if I can help it.&rdquo; And Bess spoke the truth. The
daughter of a family that had plenty of money,
Bess was a pampered child. As a general rule, she
had little regard for either of her parents. Whatever
she wanted, she asked for without regard for
cost. What she couldn&rsquo;t get from her mother, she
frequently managed to get from her father, and
the two were well on the way toward spoiling her
utterly when she went off to Lakeview with Nan.</p>

<p>There, away from home among strangers in a
place where she had to live up to certain well-defined
rules, Bess had improved considerably.
Those that have watched her since her first appearance
in &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Pine Camp&rdquo; have
seen a change come over her gradually. She is a
little more thoughtful, a little more considerate
of other people, but she still has a selfish streak
which at times like the present confronts her so
that her conscience pricks her sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I get home,&rdquo; Bess spoke more quietly
than was her wont, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do a little reforming
myself. I&rsquo;m going to pay more attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to what mother has to say. I&rsquo;m going to be a better
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am too,&rdquo; Laura agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Grace and Amelia said this together.</p>

<p>So even while Rhoda Hammond in a plane that
was winging its way toward her western home,
was remembering little, dear things about the
mother she was so fond of, her friends were thinking
of her and making resolution after resolution
about their own conduct toward their parents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>FIRST MEXICAN EXPERIENCE</small></h2>


<p>The days that followed were punctuated by
telegrams received from Rhoda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived safely.&rdquo; That was the first one. It told
nothing at all of her mother&rsquo;s condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s condition very serious. Not much
hope.&rdquo; That was the second and the girls scarcely
had the heart to go on with Adair MacKenzie&rsquo;s
party. Privately, they gave up hope entirely, but
Adair tried to keep their spirits up. &ldquo;Never can
tell about these things,&rdquo; he said after reading the
message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some improvement. Pray. Love. Rhoda.&rdquo; The
third one read, and everyone felt better.</p>

<p>Then for two days, there was no word, and
everyone&rsquo;s hope just dwindled away to nothing.
During these days, it was Walker Jamieson with
his knowledge of Mexico and its ways that put
what life there was into the party.</p>

<p>The eight hundred miles over the new Pan-American
highway from Laredo to Mexico City
was through gorgeous tropical and mountain scenery,
and all the way Walker regaled the girls with
stories and legends about Mexico and its history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>He told bloody stories of bandits coming down
out of the hills, attacking travelers, kidnaping
them and then robbing them, or holding them for
huge ransom. He told of warfare between the
Mexicans and the Indians back in the hills. He
told of lost tribes who still worshipped the Sun
God, talked their native tongue, still lived in the
way those who had built the pyramids had lived.</p>

<p>Alice listened breathlessly to all he had to say.
Nan and her friends hung on his every word.
Adair MacKenzie listened and grunted noncommittally.</p>

<p>From Laredo to Monterey, he told these
stories and from Monterey to Villa Juarez until
everyone, whether he would admit it or not, felt
deeply the spell of Mexico.</p>

<p>Then from Villa Juarez to Tamazunchale,
across rivers that were bordered by heavy tropical
foliage, everyone except Adair MacKenzie
was more or less silent absorbing quietly the
beauty about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Nan had the temerity to interrupt
one of Adair&rsquo;s outbursts against their chauffeur.
Surprised by the command, Adair chuckled and
kept quiet. Nan had heard the song of a tropical
bird. Its call was picked up by another on the
other side of the road. The chauffeur slowed down
and then, at Adair&rsquo;s command, stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few moments everyone listened, and then
Nan pushed open the door of the car and got out.
The others followed. To the right and to the left
of them the luxuriant growth made the place like
nothing else they had ever seen before. The birds
that flew out of the thicket were gorgeous things
in brilliant colors. The butterflies that drifted
from flower to flower were lovely too. But the
biggest surprise of all was the orchids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they grow wild!&rdquo; Bess was amazed. The
only ones she had ever seen before had been in
the window of a florist&rsquo;s shop on Madison Avenue
in Chicago and in a shoulder corsage worn by
Linda Riggs at a school ball. This last had made
Bess exceedingly envious, despite the fact that
Linda had been reprimanded afterwards, by Dr.
Prescott, for wearing it. And now, here they were
growing all about her, wild! Bess could scarcely
believe her eyes.</p>

<p>Walker Jamieson laughed at her. &ldquo;You like
them?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know, did you, that
they grew any place outside of a hothouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess shook her head. It was the first time in her
life that she had ever really been moved by nature
in any form. The others felt the same. The air
seemed quiet and heavy and yet full of all sorts of
strange noises too. Grace was timid in the face of
all the strangeness and held on to Nan&rsquo;s hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s eyes were big and wondrous. It was like
tropical jungles that she had read about. It was
like something she had never even dared hope to
see. She was quiet. Silently Adair MacKenzie
watched her, and felt pleased with himself that he
had shown it to her. In regarding her, he felt
almost as though he himself had created it for her
special benefit.</p>

<p>She caught his glance, looked up at him and
grinned. &ldquo;Wish I could take a piece of it home
with me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson sounded as
though that would be the simplest thing in the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Nan asked in the tone of one who
didn&rsquo;t believe a word of what she heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy.&rdquo; Jamieson&rsquo;s eyes twinkled, for he knew
that she thought that this was only another bit of
his foolishness. &ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve got to do is get a
camera and take a picture. Then you&rsquo;ll have it
for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nan was serious too now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, I&rsquo;ve no camera and secondly, I don&rsquo;t
know how to take pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; Walker Jamieson
waved these difficulties aside as though they
didn&rsquo;t amount to anything. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a camera in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the car, and, if you want, I&rsquo;ll show you how to get
the best results. I&rsquo;m in your debt anyway,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that about the camera and
everything?&rdquo; Nan was incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean it? It&rsquo;s a promise, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Walker
drew Alice into the conversation.</p>

<p>She nodded her head happily. She knew, if Nan
didn&rsquo;t, that Walker had made a hobby of photography
and just the year before, had won a prize in
a national show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin, just as soon as we get back in
that car,&rdquo; Jamieson promised further. &ldquo;When we
get to Mexico City, we&rsquo;ll buy some more films and
the camera is yours to do with as you will until
we return to the States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, because of an impulsive wish and an impulsive
promise, Nan began almost immediately to
develop a hobby that, even before her Mexican
adventure was over, was going to have amazing
consequences.</p>

<p>From Tamazunchale to Mexico City, the drive
was quite another experience. The road now was
hewn out of sheer mountain rock. The car climbed
and climbed, until the girls&rsquo; ears felt strange and
Bess declared that she could hardly breathe. She
forgot this, however, when they, upon Alice&rsquo;s insistence,
this time, got out again. All around them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
huge mountain peaks rose to great heights making
them all, except, perhaps, Adair MacKenzie,
feel small and insignificant.</p>

<p>Straight down below them they saw rivers and
waterfalls that looked small and white and unimportant,
like a thread that some mighty hand had
dropped carelessly in the greenness. Then they
got in the car, went down the mountainside again,
and they came to a lovely white village in a fertile
green valley.</p>

<p>Here they stopped and ate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t understand this jargon,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
laid the menu that had been given him
down and looked utterly disgusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sense in their making it like this,&rdquo; he continued
as though it was a personal insult that anyone
should presume to speak or write any other
language than English. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see how they can
understand it themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, it was Walker Jamieson who did
the ordering. &ldquo;How about some nice mode de
guajolote?&rdquo; he grinned at Nan and her friends as
he put the question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s turkey to you,&rdquo; he explained
when they laughed, &ldquo;stuffed turkey to be
exact and a choice bit here. With it, we&rsquo;ll have
tortillas, the Mexican substitute for bread, and
frijoles, the favorite Mexican bean. Sound all
right?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls nodded as they tried to find the items
on their own menus. And Adair MacKenzie
grunted that he would take the same.</p>

<p>The meal wasn&rsquo;t entirely a success. Nan and
her friends enjoyed it, but Adair MacKenzie
grumbled throughout despite all that Alice could
do to mollify him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, daddy,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;in a
couple of more days we&rsquo;ll be at the hacienda&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that housekeeper of ours better be
there, or I&rsquo;ll fire her.&rdquo; Adair was off again.</p>

<p>Alice restrained a smile. For twenty years now,
Adair had been firing the housekeeper and for
twenty years she had been running him and his
house just as she pleased. It was a joke that the
motherly old lady and Alice shared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; Alice tried to reassure him,
&ldquo;and so will that Chinese cook that we have heard
so much about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and the rest looked up from their turkey,
half expecting a story, but Alice said nothing
further. They finished the meal in silence and followed
Adair to the car.</p>

<p>Then, by way of Zimapan, an attractive hillside
village, remembered ever afterwards by the
girls for its huge cacti, some more than thirty-five
feet high, they continued on toward Mexico City.
They passed through Tasquillo, and then over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sandy road between other tall cacti to Ixmiquilpan,
a picturesque town where native Indians
were tending sheep and spinning along the streets.</p>

<p>Here Nan took a picture, the first of many she
was to take, of the girls as they stood in a market
where they had just bought some gayly woven
baskets. The sight of the Indians brought more
stories to Walker&rsquo;s mind and so, in the few miles
that lay between them and their stopping place
for the night, he told more tales.</p>

<p>He told stories of buried treasure left by the
Aztecs in deep underground chambers, of turquoise
and jade that was more lovely than any
the modern world has discovered. He told of gold
so plentiful that it had no value, of great temples
that American Museums were spending hundreds
of thousands of dollars to rebuild.</p>

<p>He knew all the stories, because, since his early
childhood, spent in California where Mexican labor
was plentiful because it was cheap, he had
been interested in the country.</p>

<p>When, on the third day of their journey, they
approached Mexico City, Walker Jamieson was
in a particularly expansive mood, one designed to
keep their minds off the question of what word
they would find from Rhoda in the capital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Below you, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with a great sweep of his arm, &ldquo;you see Mexico
City, the capital of this surprising republic of
Mexico. There you will find romance, adventure,
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>A LEGEND</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Mexico City,&rdquo; he went on, as though he were
a guide introducing a party of tourists to its first
sight of a city, &ldquo;lies, as you can see from here, in
a mountain valley on the Great Central Plateau.
Constructed on a former lake by those Aztecs
who once made of this whole region a grand and
glorious place, it was called by them &lsquo;Tenochtitlan&rsquo;,
an Aztec word meaning &lsquo;Belonging to the
property of the Temple.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Spaniards conquered Tenochtitlan,
they found grand palaces and elegant homes
under the shadow of the mountains that lie all
about. They found gardens more beautiful and
more highly cultivated than any they had ever
known. They found wealth and splendour such
as not even their vivid imaginations had ever constructed.
They found everything,&rdquo; he finished
dramatically, &ldquo;and they drove the people who had
conceived it out, and they took it unto themselves,
and it went to ruin. You see now, the modern city,
and as you go through its streets, you will find
everywhere evidences of all these changes living
side by side with the new that the present generation
is in the process of building up.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Walker Jamieson had started his little harangue
half in fun, but as always when he talked about
the old city, he grew serious as he went on. Now,
as he noted the half scowl on Adair MacKenzie&rsquo;s
face, the look of interest on Alice&rsquo;s, and the attention
of Nan Sherwood and her friends, he paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I doing?&rdquo; he directed the question to
the group in general.</p>

<p>Adair MacKenzie grunted.</p>

<p>Alice beamed, her eyes full of pride in him.</p>

<p>And Nan and her crowd nodded their heads for
him to go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, my public adores me,&rdquo; he said in a mocking
self-satisfied tone that caused Alice and Nan
to laugh aloud.</p>

<p>With this he wrapped his guide&rsquo;s cloak about
him again and went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you go about,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and look up from
day to day at the mountains that surround you,
you will soon be able to name them all from
Chiquihuite, &lsquo;the basket&rsquo;, to El Cerro Gordo, &lsquo;the
fat hill&rsquo;, but there is none that has a more fascinating
story than La Sierra Madre over there to the
west.&rdquo; He pointed as he spoke. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the famous
one with the two volcanoes, Ixtaccihuatl, &lsquo;the
white woman&rsquo;, and Popocatepetl, &lsquo;the mountain
that smokes&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one time, before the great Cortez conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the country, these volcanoes were worshipped
as deities. There were days set aside for
their veneration, feasts in their honor, and elaborate
ceremonies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just imagine,&rdquo; Laura interrupted, &ldquo;having a
feast in honor of a mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Walker Jamieson agreed.
&ldquo;But wait, I have even stranger things to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt.&rdquo; The remark was Adair
MacKenzie&rsquo;s who, whether he would admit it or
not, was really enjoying himself thoroughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ixtaccihuatl had a wooden idol representing
her in the Great Temple and Popocatepetl a representation
of dough of amarand and maize seeds.
These idols you will see in the great museums of
the city. The legend that surrounds them, if you
will bear with me, goes something like this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ixtaccihuatl was the beautiful daughter of a
proud and powerful Aztec Emperor and his only
child. As such, she was heir to his throne and
watched and guarded throughout her youth. Her
father adored her, but as he grew old and weak
and his enemies began to wage war against him,
he realized more and more how difficult it would
be for a woman to hold together his vast and
wealthy empire. So he set out to find a husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
worthy of his daughter, worthy of the splendour
that would be hers after his death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He called to his aid all the proud young warriors
of his tribe and offered his daughter in
marriage and his throne to the one among them
who would conquer his enemies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Popocatepetl that you see yonder went
into the fight. He had long been in love with the
beautiful princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war was long. It was cruel. It was bloody.
But Popocatepetl endured to the end. Ah, but he
was proud and triumphant when he saw that it
would surely be he who would return to claim the
princess whom he loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But alas, his triumph was short-lived. His enemies,
having failed in battle, stooped to the lowest
form of deceit. They sent back to the Princess
the false news that her beloved had been killed.
She languished and became ill of a strange malady
that not even the smartest witch doctors in the
realm could cure her of. She died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Popocatepetl&rsquo;s grief was more than he could
bear. He wished to die too, so he caused to be
constructed a great pyramid upon which he himself
laid the beautiful Ixtaccihuatl. Next to it, he
built another. There, he stands, holding a funeral
torch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The snow has enfolded her body and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that of the man that would have married her, but
it has never covered the torch which burns on, a
symbol of the love of Popocatepetl for
Ixtaccihuatl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the smoke,&rdquo; Nan said quietly when she
saw that he had finished, &ldquo;of the volcano is the
smoke of the torch&rsquo;s flame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smart girl,&rdquo; Walker Jamieson slipped into a
lighter mood now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they believed that story?&rdquo; Bess sounded
incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, O doubtful one,&rdquo; Laura answered the
question, &ldquo;and they had feasts for the couple.
Didn&rsquo;t you listen to the beginning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm-m, they probably weren&rsquo;t edible,&rdquo; Adair
MacKenzie suddenly remembered the meal he
had found so distasteful a short time before.</p>

<p>Walker winked at Alice who patted her father
on the arm, &ldquo;Never mind, dad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll
be food that you like later on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late then.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie was not to
be mollified now. &ldquo;Be all burned up before then
by these confounded Mexican chiles. Must have
a million varieties. Find them in everything.
Afraid even to order ice-cream. Probably comes
with a special chile sauce on it. Somebody ought to
teach these Mexicans how to eat. Do it myself if
I had time. Always think that when I come here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Teach them that and how to build roads,&rdquo; he
added as the car bumped over the highway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;re coming into some sort of civilized
city, now.&rdquo; He looked about himself with
some degree of satisfaction, for as Walker had
proceeded with his account of the legend of the
two famous volcanoes, the car had been progressing
toward the city. Now it was on the outskirts
and Nan and Bess, Grace and Amelia and Laura
were craning their necks so as not to miss one
single sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice it would be,&rdquo; Amelia remarked to
the group after she had missed something that
Walker had pointed out on the side of the road
opposite to the one she had been watching, &ldquo;to
have a face on all sides of your head so that you
could see all ways at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is,&rdquo; Laura returned dryly,
&ldquo;that you are doing pretty well with the one that
you have. You might have missed the old flower
woman back there, but you are certainly making
up for it now.&rdquo; With this she laughed and pushed
Amelia&rsquo;s head, that was now blocking her own
line of vision, out of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such pretty young girls,&rdquo; Nan remarked as
the car stopped at a crossroad to let a half dozen
Mexicans cross the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they though?&rdquo; Bess agreed. &ldquo;One of
them looked just like Juanita. Remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course Nan remembered the girl that had
been involved in the hidden treasure plot that was
recounted in the story &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Rose
Ranch.&rdquo; The thought of her now brought Rhoda
back to mind and her mother, and with it a return
of the anxiety they had felt at not having heard
recently from their friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>LINDA RIGGS TURNS UP</small></h2>


<p>Adair MacKenzie was quick to note the change
in their mood. &ldquo;Wells Fargo and Co., Madero
14.&rdquo; He gave instructions to the chauffeur, and
then turned to Nan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the American Express
of this country,&rdquo; he explained in a tone that indicated
that they had no right to call it other than
the &ldquo;American Express&rdquo;. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick up mail
there. You see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done to the old man?&rdquo; Walker
Jamieson questioned as he helped Nan out of the
car a few minutes later. &ldquo;Why, Alice,&rdquo; he continued,
assisting her too, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s practically putty in
her hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Alice smiled as she took Nan&rsquo;s arm
and walked along beside her. &ldquo;It is amazing and
I&rsquo;m almost jealous. I thought that I was the only
one in the world that could manage him.&rdquo; She
looked fondly in the direction of Adair MacKenzie
who had already passed through the door and
was at the counter inside demanding his mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, what did I tell you?&rdquo; He asked triumphantly
when they all entered together. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a whole bunch of mail here. See.&rdquo; He held up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
truly large package of letters, letters from home
for each of the girls. As they all crowded around
him, he teased them by delaying the process of
handing them out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, this one looks interesting, mighty
interesting.&rdquo; He lingered over the address. &ldquo;But
the writing isn&rsquo;t very clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice reached for it as though to help him out.
He raised his arm high. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not for you,&rdquo; he
shook his head at her. &ldquo;This mailman always
delivers his mail to the proper person. Now, stand
back all of you, while I look again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is as bad or worse than it is at school
when they distribute mail, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Laura nudged
Nan. &ldquo;But look, isn&rsquo;t the old duck getting a kick
out of it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan nodded. There was only one thing that she
was really impatient about. She wanted to know
now, right away, whether there was any word
from Rhoda. She felt as though she couldn&rsquo;t stand
it a moment longer not to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Cousin Adair,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;is there
anything there at all from Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, tell us quickly,&rdquo; Alice chimed in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie was immediately
all contrition. &ldquo;H-m-m, wait.&rdquo; He
leafed quickly through the pack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is something,&rdquo; he admitted at last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s addressed to Nan.&rdquo; With this he handed a
yellow telegram over to her. &ldquo;Take it easily,&rdquo; he
advised, while they all waited anxiously for Nan
to open it. She tore the seal, pulled the message
out, dropped it in her nervousness, and then when
it was restored to her hands, read it slowly to
herself.</p>

<p>At long last she looked up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; she caught
her breath before she could continue&mdash;&ldquo;all right.
Rhoda&rsquo;s mother is going to get well.&rdquo; Saying this,
she passed the telegram over to Bess and Laura,
and then, before she realized at all what was happening,
her eyes welled up with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan, darling!&rdquo; Alice exclaimed, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
cry. Everything&rsquo;s all right now. Come,&rdquo; she drew
from her own purse a pretty white handkerchief
and wiped Nan&rsquo;s tears away, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have us all
in tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan took the handkerchief away from her and
wiped her own eyes, hard. Then she smiled.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just an old
silly. Please, cousin Adair, what&rsquo;s in the rest of
that package.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; Even Adair MacKenzie
sounded as though he had lost possession of himself
for a moment. Now, he collected himself
again and took the party in his hands, as he had
had it before. &ldquo;Too much stalling around here,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he grumbled to no one in particular, and then
went on with the distribution of the mail.</p>

<p>The letters from home were fun to get, fun to
read, and fun to share. Each one was read and
re-read a dozen times by the girl that received it,
and then it was passed around and enjoyed by all
the others. There were letters from their mothers
and fathers and letters from their friends. There
was a round robin from their pals at school.</p>

<p>Though all of them had news, this last had the
choicest bits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that,&rdquo; it began, &ldquo;Professor
Krenner and Dr. Beulah Prescott are going to be
married before the summer is over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; Bess stopped Nan who was reading the
bit aloud to the others, &ldquo;is it true? Did I hear
you right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you did,&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s eyes looked merry
now. She of all the girls had been the only one
who knew that this announcement was coming.
Beloved by Dr. Beulah and the best student and
most wide-awake person that had ever come to
Dr. Krenner&rsquo;s attention, she had been in their
confidence before school had closed.</p>

<p>The romance between the Principal of Lakeview
and one of its most scholarly instructors had
blossomed the summer the two had escorted the
present group of girls on their European trip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Professor Krenner joined the party in London,
just before the coronation. There he and Dr.
Prescott learned of the million and one things
they had in common. Nan knew of this, knew too
that the wedding was to take place in the chapel
at Lakeview just before school opened. Already,
she had planned to attend.</p>

<p>Now, she went on with the reading of the round
robin. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that the
old boathouse where we had that grand party on
Bess&rsquo;s twenty-five dollars, is going to be pulled
down and a big new one built?</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the dormitories are being redecorated
and that corridor four where we have rooms is
going to have all the walls done over and that
serapes will look especially nice hanging on them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that, and this is the biggest piece of news
of all, Linda Riggs is someplace in Mexico?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the exclamation was Bess&rsquo;s. If it was
possible to say that one girl in the room disliked
the proud Linda more than the rest, Bess was
that girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate her. I just hate her.&rdquo; Bess had said
vehemently many times. And well she might, for
often in the days that followed the registration of
Bess and Nan at Lakeview, Linda had purposely
embarrassed and humiliated them. At first, Bess,
because she naturally coveted wealth, and Linda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was a very wealthy girl, had tried to make friends
with &ldquo;Her Highness&rdquo; as Laura dubbed Linda.
But her efforts always ended disastrously.</p>

<p>Nan, as all those who have followed the fortunes
of the young girl know, time and again
tried to help Linda. Once or twice she was instrumental
in saving her life. But despite this, whenever
Linda was in a position to do so, she
managed to belittle Nan, to snub her rudely, to
make her just as uncomfortable as she possibly
could.</p>

<p>So Nan and Bess had particular reasons for
disliking the girl who had even been expelled from
school for one bit of meanness that caused an
explosion which might easily have cost the lives
of many of the Lakeview Hall students. Linda,
in other words, was cordially hated by most of the
students of the fashionable boarding school.</p>

<p>Now, the news that she was in Mexico brought
consternation to the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I&rsquo;ve always said,&rdquo; Bess fumed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to go anyplace without having
her turn up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably likes you and just won&rsquo;t admit it.&rdquo;
Laura could well afford to add fuel to the flame.
Linda generally avoided her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like me and you know it, Laura
Polk,&rdquo; Bess exclaimed. &ldquo;Why she had to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
down here when there&rsquo;s all the rest of the world
for her to travel in, I don&rsquo;t know. But you can
just be sure of this, no good will come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! Bess,&rdquo; Nan warned as she looked over to
one side where Adair MacKenzie, Alice, and
Walker Jamieson were deep in consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Nan,&rdquo; Bess lowered her voice, &ldquo;but
I just don&rsquo;t seem to be able to control myself
when that girl comes to mind. She&rsquo;s caused us so
much unhappiness that I can&rsquo;t stand her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nan was genuinely sympathetic, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t you worry, we probably won&rsquo;t see her at all.
Mexico, after all, is a pretty big place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has twenty-seven states, besides the
Federal District and the Territory of Lower California.&rdquo;
Laura quoted the guidebook glibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; Bess said
firmly. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s anywhere in the country, there&rsquo;s
no escaping her. We&rsquo;ll meet her.&rdquo; She ended
positively.</p>

<p>How truly Bess spoke, the crowd was soon to
find out, but the circumstances and the far-reaching
results must be left to other chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>NAN TURNS PHOTOGRAPHER</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s on the program this morning?&rdquo;
Adair MacKenzie was in a genial mood the day
after the telegram had informed the girls that
Rhoda&rsquo;s mother was going to recover.</p>

<p>He had had a good night&rsquo;s sleep and a generous
well-cooked breakfast in the fashionable hotel
where he had chosen to take his brood. Though
he had complained about the coffee in no uncertain
terms, as is the custom of most Americans traveling
in foreign countries, the rest of the food had
seemed good and now he acted as though he was
entirely at the disposal of his guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Jamieson?&rdquo; He turned to
the young newspaper man. &ldquo;Got any ideas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only those that we talked over at Wells
Fargo&rsquo;s yesterday.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson assumed a
mysterious air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that, that has to wait until the afternoon,&rdquo;
Adair MacKenzie looked mysterious too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we might just explore the city, take the
buses and street cars and find out how the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
get around. We might let the girls get a glimpse
of The Cathedral, one of the most important in
all of the Americas. It was built over the old
Aztec Templo Mayor and it took two and a half
centuries to build.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two and a half centuries to build a church!&rdquo;
Laura exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you expect?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
asked in a tone that indicated he was not the least
bit surprised, &ldquo;of a nation that has &lsquo;mañana&rsquo; for
its motto?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker Jamieson laughed heartily at this.
&ldquo;Well, maybe you are right,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find your interpretation in any
guidebook. They say merely that the Indians contributed
a third of the cost and all the work and
that &lsquo;many died each day due to the long hours
of unaccustomed strenuous work.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, they&rsquo;ll never admit they are
wrong,&rdquo; Adair shook his head as though this fact
grieved him deeply. &ldquo;Never be afraid, you Nan,&rdquo;
he pointed his finger sternly at his young cousin,
&ldquo;to admit you are wrong. Best medicine in the
world. If you are wrong say so. It&rsquo;s good for
you.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie had a habit of talking
thus in circles, agreeing with himself over some
great truth. Now he nodded his head with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
satisfaction as though he himself made a practice
of admitting his mistakes.</p>

<p>Walker looked at Alice. Alice looked at
Walker. They both laughed. Both knew that the
old man had never in his life admitted that he had
made a mistake. Both at this moment thought
him charming and lovable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, shall we leave The Cathedral out
then?&rdquo; Walker Jamieson was always willing to
give in in little particulars. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty else
to see, palaces, parks, markets. Why, there&rsquo;s a
whole new city to explore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t leave anything out,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
looked at his watch as he spoke, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve
got to do everything up in a hurry. Haven&rsquo;t got
much time to stay in this city. Got a telegram this
morning from the caretaker at the Hacienda. Expects
us there within the next couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, daddy,&rdquo; Alice laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way
you always are. Always wanting to move on just
as soon as we arrive at a place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he twitted, &ldquo;mañana is always good
enough for you. You&rsquo;re just a lazy beggar. Now,
what do you want to do today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything, just everything,&rdquo; Alice looked
as though she would like to do it all and do it
now. She had that happy faculty that some people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have of always having a good time no matter
what happens.</p>

<p>Nan had it too. The word &ldquo;bore&rdquo; which slips
so easily from the tongues of many young people
who really shouldn&rsquo;t know what boredom is, had
never crossed her lips. Life seemed too full of
adventure, too full of a number of things to do
for her to even think of applying it to herself.
Linda Riggs might have used the word, but never
Nan, and never Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s your answer,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
turned to Walker when Alice answered that she
wanted to do &ldquo;just everything.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a typical
woman&rsquo;s answer. Now, do what you want to
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-kay.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson assumed the responsibility
willingly enough. &ldquo;Now, listen here,&rdquo;
he turned to the girls and assumed a serious air
and a stern one that unfortunately didn&rsquo;t impress
them at all, and said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got just about four
hours in this day to do with as you want to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four hours!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;why, how
short the days are here! It&rsquo;s only nine o&rsquo;clock
now, or is Amelia&rsquo;s watch slow?&rdquo; She had been
looking at Amelia&rsquo;s wrist as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said four hours.&rdquo; Walker repeated, still
sternly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He said four hours.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie was
equally stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, why don&rsquo;t you get started,&rdquo; Alice
teased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, here. We are.&rdquo; Walker pretended
that he was angry and that Alice&rsquo;s remark was
just the last straw. He took her by the arm and
with the others following after, they all left the
dining room, walked through the lounge and then
out into the morning sunshine.</p>

<p>The four hours flew by. They shopped in the
busy Mexican markets, bartered with natives,
dressed in brilliantly colored blankets and huge
sombreros, bought serapes, beautiful Indian pottery,
some opals that were sold by the dozen,
handwoven baskets and a million and one little
things that Walker declared would fill a trunk.</p>

<p>Nan took her camera along and snapped pictures
of everyone, pretty Mexican señoritas selling
flowers, little Mexican boys who were boot-blacks,
proud of the American slang they had
learned in the movies, and whole families complete
with shawls, squatting over low fires making
tortillas for whomsoever would buy.</p>

<p>She took pictures until in her enthusiasm she
forgot herself entirely and asked Adair MacKenzie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
if he would please hold a little Mexican
baby while she photographed it.</p>

<p>As soon as the question was out of her mouth,
she realized that she had made a mistake.</p>

<p>What a torrent it brought forth! Adair MacKenzie
blustered as he had never blustered before.
He would see himself tied and hung before she
would ever find him even touching one of those
kids. Why, the idea. Did she think he was an
embassador of good will, that he was down there
to kiss babies and wear serapes to show that he
was just one of the people. Did&mdash;d&mdash;did she think
he was&mdash;why, what did she think he was? He
stuttered in his surprise.</p>

<p>Finally, Nan and Walker and Alice and all the
rest broke down in laughter, for Adair MacKenzie
was certainly outdoing himself.</p>

<p>With this, he stopped in amazement. And they
were laughing at him! &ldquo;No respect any more at
all,&rdquo; he muttered and then he laughed too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Walker, you,&rdquo; he took the remaining bit
of his impatience out on that able young man,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no sense at all in that head of yours. Let
the girls get out of hand all the time. Now, I&rsquo;m
going to take charge of the party. Had enough of
your nonsense. Come on, you,&rdquo; he turned to Nan
and the rest with this, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be no more pictures
today. We&rsquo;re going back to the hotel now.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; Alice ventured to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. Just wait. You&rsquo;ll see. This is my
party now.&rdquo; So, he right-about-faced and went
striding from the market with the others following
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>SMUGGLERS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;A bullfight, Bess, we&rsquo;re going to a bullfight,&rdquo;
Nan exclaimed as she and Bess dressed for the
afternoon excursion with Adair MacKenzie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy Sherwood, I never in all the
world thought you were the bloodthirsty creature
that you are,&rdquo; Bess laughed at her pal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are just the same, Elizabeth Harley,&rdquo;
Nan returned. &ldquo;When Cousin Adair told us at
the luncheon table what we were going to do this
afternoon, you were just as excited as the rest
of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Bess confessed. &ldquo;But I expect to
hold my ears and close my eyes through the worst
parts. They do say they can be very gory spectacles
with blood streaming all over everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Nan admitted. &ldquo;It scares me
to think of that part, but I want to see it anyway.&rdquo;
As the girls talked, they dressed, combed their
hair, and then tidied up the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Laura stuck her head through the
door and asked. &ldquo;Amelia and Grace are already
downstairs. We better get started, or Grace will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
be backing down. Really, I think she&rsquo;s scared to
death, but is afraid to admit it. Me, I&rsquo;m going
to love this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Nan admitted. &ldquo;I can hardly wait.
I&rsquo;ve read about them so often. Remember the
lecturer at Lakeview who had all those slides
about bullfights in Spain. I&rsquo;ve wanted to see one
ever since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Cupp was so angry over that. She
didn&rsquo;t think it was the proper sort of thing for
young ladies to see. She thought it would coarsen
them,&rdquo; Laura finished primly. &ldquo;Wait until we get
back to Lakeview, will we ever have some tales to
tell her that will make her hair stand on end!
She&rsquo;ll have to go to bed for a week to recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura,&rdquo; Nan laughed, &ldquo;you sound as
though you&rsquo;d be brave enough to tell her all about
it yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Laura joined in the laughter,
&ldquo;because we aren&rsquo;t exactly bosom pals, you
know, she&rsquo;ll find out. Nothing escapes her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truer words were never spoken,&rdquo; Nan agreed
as she adjusted her hat in front of the mirror.
&ldquo;Come on, now, I&rsquo;m ready. Are you, Bess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a second.&rdquo; Bess was rummaging through
her purse. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s everything here except the
thing I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks almost like an over-night bag,&rdquo; Laura<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
commented as Bess poured the contents out on
the dresser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you looking for?&rdquo; Nan
asked somewhat impatiently. Bess never could find
things in her purse because she had a habit of
saving everything and never cleaning the pocket-book
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my passport&mdash;I mean my visitors&rsquo; pass.&rdquo;
Bess really did look worried. &ldquo;I had it this morning.
I know I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I can say is,&rdquo; Laura commented dryly, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ve lost that, you might just as well go out
and drown yourself, because if you don&rsquo;t, Mr.
MacKenzie will roar so loud when you tell him
that the earth will just open up and swallow us
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo; Bess was almost in tears. She
didn&rsquo;t like to be roared at. She took scoldings
harder than anyone else in the crowd, because at
home she had always been made to feel that what
she did was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bessie, you&rsquo;re such a silly,&rdquo; Nan laughed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the wrong pocket-book. That isn&rsquo;t
the one you had with you this morning. You had
the little black one and that&rsquo;s over there on your
trunk. Remember, you put it there when you came
in so that you would be sure to know where it was
when you wanted it again.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess laughed too now. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just like me,
always hunting for something and always finding
it just where it ought to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do that too,&rdquo; Laura sympathized as they
three left the room. And so does everyone, but
Bess had a habit of getting confused and impatient
as soon as things went wrong and using all her
energy in getting excited. Nan generally remained
calm and found things. Laura was calm too and
that because she never took anything very seriously.
If she couldn&rsquo;t find one thing, another
would do, and so she always went happily on
her way.</p>

<p>Bess was thinking of this, as Nan pushed the
button for the automatic elevator. &ldquo;But you
couldn&rsquo;t have substituted anything for the visitors&rsquo;
pass.&rdquo; She directed her remark to Laura as
though they had been talking over the thing she
was thinking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever are you talking about?&rdquo; Laura
laughed. &ldquo;Or, is it a secret? You know what happens
to people in this country who go around
talking to themselves? They throw them to the
bulls. Now, come on, Bessie,&rdquo; she finished. &ldquo;You
may be a harum-scarum child, but we love you.
Cheer up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the elevator jolted and settled to its
place on the first floor and the three girls stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
out to find Adair, Alice, Walker Jamieson and
the rest all waiting for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you had cold feet, and were backing
out.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson greeted them with this
sally as they all walked down the entrance stairs
and out to their waiting car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Nan pointed at a street car they were
passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what?&rdquo; Laura questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you were too late,&rdquo; Nan answered while
she adjusted her camera so that it would be ready
for her to take pictures when she wanted to.
&ldquo;There was a sign on that car which said,
&lsquo;Toreo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Grace questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bullfight, darling, that&rsquo;s where you are going
now,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s the sign that
Nan saw again. It&rsquo;s on the front of that bus that&rsquo;s
stopped across the street. This must be a holiday.
Practically everyone seems to have dusted off his
best sombrero and come out on the streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a holiday everyday here.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
turned around to join in the conversation.
&ldquo;Saw a calendar of festivals posted in the hotel
lobby. No end to it. No wonder the people never
get anything done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that too,&rdquo; Walker Jamieson remarked.
&ldquo;Saw something else posted on a bulletin board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that was interesting. It was a warning to everyone
to take good care of his visitor&rsquo;s pass. Right beside
it was the announcement of a reward being
offered to anyone who could give information as
to the whereabouts of one Antonio Mazaro, an
American citizen and former aviator, who is suspected
of being an accomplice in an international
smuggling ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be the smugglers Mr. Nogales
told us about at the border,&rdquo; Nan remarked.</p>

<p>Walker Jamieson said nothing further. The
truth, was, however, that he had just an hour before
received an assignment from a big New York
newspaper to cover certain aspects of this smuggling
ring story, and he was already wondering
whether or not it was going to be possible for him
to go on to the Hacienda as he had planned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Mexicans will never catch anyone, much
less a band of American crooks.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
looked around again. &ldquo;Need a couple of good
G-men down here, if they&rsquo;re going to find out anything
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think so too,&rdquo; Walker agreed, &ldquo;they are
sending some down, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got your nose in the story?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
asked abruptly, and everyone looked at
Walker, waiting for his answer.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>A BULLFIGHT</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, always interested in whatever goes on,&rdquo;
Walker answered off-handedly. &ldquo;You know how
it is. See a story breaking, you want to be in on
the kill. Just can&rsquo;t help yourself. Gets in your
blood, after you&rsquo;ve worked on any paper for a
while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back four years ago, I went up into northern
Canada for a vacation. Chose that spot because
I thought it would be far away from newspapers
and stories of all kinds. I guess I was feeling
rather disgusted with everything and wanted to
get away, so when an old newspaper buddy who
had struck out a claim for himself asked me to go
up and do a little prospecting for gold with him,
I jumped at the chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looked like an ideal set-up. We were to go
alone to his cabin which was miles away from
civilization and stay there for the summer. We
stocked up with plenty of food, some books I had
been wanting to read for a long time, and took a
radio along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a book I wanted to write, something I
had started and never found time to finish. Oh, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was nothing,&rdquo; he added as Nan and the rest
looked impressed. &ldquo;All newspaper people think
that some day they&rsquo;ll write a book that will take
the world by storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought I would finish that, do some
prospecting and just have a nice quiet time for
myself. The chap I was going up with was a nice
sort of fellow, quiet like myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went by train as far as we could go, and
then got an old Indian to paddle us the rest of the
way in a canoe. It was nice going. We took it leisurely,
stopped and fished along the banks of the
river, and camped for three days in a gorgeous
spot that seemed as remote from civilization as
any place could possibly be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things went along quite perfectly until one
night&mdash;this was after we had been in the camp for
a couple of weeks&mdash;there was a radio call &lsquo;Plane
carrying doctor and infantile paralysis serum to
Canadian outpost in Northwest down. Position
approximately&rsquo;&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it was
now, but it was not far from our camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning we were up at daybreak and
by the next afternoon we had located the plane.
The pilot was dead, but the doctor, though suffering
from a broken leg and shock, was still living.
After we had fixed him up, we spent the
night trying to get the plane&rsquo;s radio to the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
where it would function, so that we could get the
news back to civilization.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But things were so radically wrong with it,
that my pal finally decided that he would set out
for the nearest outpost, traveling as we had when
we came, walking and by canoe. In the meantime,
the doctor was fretting and stewing because he
couldn&rsquo;t get to the station that was in such urgent
need of medical aid, so partly on this insistence,
partly because I&rsquo;m a stubborn fool when I start
out to do anything, I kept tinkering around with
the radio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, the thing came to life, and we were
able to get in touch with the outside world. You
know as well as I what happens in such cases. It
wasn&rsquo;t long before I was up to my neck, sending
exclusive stories back to my old sheet and then,
when another plane came to take the doctor and
brought with it a whole flock of reporters, I was
swamped with work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grumbled, but I loved it, and when the story
died down and I was called back to work on an
assignment that I was more than proud to accept
I was like a kid with a new toy. Never so glad to
get back into harness in my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel now, a little the way I did then. Mexico
and the land of mañana spelled romance and
rest to me in the city room where I do my daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stint. But now I want neither of them. I smell a
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, he sniffed the air as though he was
actually trying to get the direction of the scent.
Alice laughed and held her hand on the handle of
the door. &ldquo;Maybe you do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re
not leaving us today, at least not this minute.
Walker Jamieson, we&rsquo;re headed for a bullfight
and you&rsquo;re going along with us whether you want
to or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no protest, and Walker was glad
afterwards when he pieced the little sections of
the plot together that he hadn&rsquo;t struck out on the
trail of the story before that memorable bull-fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the man with the wheelbarrow doing
in the parade?&rdquo; Nan asked the question of
Walker Jamieson.</p>

<p>They were all sitting now in the huge arena,
&ldquo;Plaza de Toros,&rdquo; the most important bull-fighting
ring in all Mexico. The place was packed and
Nan thought as she looked out over the people
that she had never in her life seen such a gay colorful
crowd, nor one in such an excited mood.</p>

<p>They were sitting on the shady side of the
ring, &ldquo;Sombra&rdquo; it was called, the seats of which
cost twice the price of those on the sunny side, or
&ldquo;Sol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock exactly and the cuadrilla or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
parade that precedes every bull-fight had just
entered the arena. Everyone was standing up
shouting, waving his sombrero, and cheering for
his favorite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret, not to be divulged until later,&rdquo;
Walker answered Nan&rsquo;s question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it would be like this,&rdquo; Grace,
generally so quiet and shy, said. Her face was all
alight and she was waving the pillow that had
been bought for her to sit on, as were all the rest
of the girls and women in the place. Laura was
waving hers too, and so were Bess and Nan and
Amelia.</p>

<p>Down in the ring below them the parade was
marching around. First came a man on a spirited
horse that pranced and danced and bowed its
head to the ground again and again as the rider
circled the ring. Then followed the matadores or
bullfighters themselves in brilliant costumes that
proclaimed to everyone that they were the heroes
of the hour. It was for them that pillows were
waved and cheers echoed back and forth across
the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re gorgeous, simply gorgeous,&rdquo; Nan
was carried away with the excitement. &ldquo;What are
they called?&rdquo; she pointed her finger to a number
of men now riding on horseback and directed her
question to Walker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And look, what are they?&rdquo; Laura turned to
him at the same time. She was pointing to men in
white suits, red sashes, and caps who came in on
mules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One at a time, please,&rdquo; Walker laughed at
their excitement. &ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s first. Those men on
horseback are the picadores. Watch them later.
And you, Señorita,&rdquo; he turned to Laura, &ldquo;you
asked about the wise monkeys, &lsquo;monosabios&rsquo; we
Mexicans call them. When the fight&rsquo;s over they&rsquo;ll
drag out the dead bull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The exclamation was Grace&rsquo;s. She had
forgotten that a bullfight meant that there would
be blood and killing.</p>

<p>Walker looked at her questioningly and then
at Alice. &ldquo;Here was a girl,&rdquo; the glances they exchanged
said, &ldquo;that would have to be watched at
the killing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, below them, the horseman leading the
procession bowed before the judge of the bullfight,
the formation disbanded, and the ring
cleared for the entrance of the first bull.</p>

<p>It came in, charging from a door that was
opened below the ring, went bellowing madly
across the arena, and charged straight into a target
that maddened it further.</p>

<p>Now the prettiest, most graceful part of the
whole spectacle began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Two helpers carrying lovely bright capes
stepped from the side into the arena. One of them
waved his cape, attracting the attention of the
bull which came rushing toward the bright moving
object. The helper danced gracefully aside.
The bull turned and rushed at him again, putting
his head down and going for him with his horns.
But the man was graceful and daring and teasing
and avoided him.</p>

<p>Now the other helper waved his cape and was
equally provocative and the bull went for him
with the same lack of success.</p>

<p>So they played back and forth, tantalizing the
bull, attracting it with one cape and distracting it
with another until it was thoroughly maddened.</p>

<p>Then the rider came in on his horse and the
rider and the horse teased the bull further. So it
went until the climax when the third and most
important part of the fight began&mdash;the actual killing
of the bull.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>END OF THE FIGHT</small></h2>


<p>The ring was in a furor when Bess clutched
Nan&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look, Nan, look,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
she. It&rsquo;s Linda. Look, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s eyes were riveted on the ring, where the
bullfighter with his spear was waiting for a propitious
moment to plunge it into the mad bleeding
animal that was lunging at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Bess,&rdquo; Nan hadn&rsquo;t heard what
her friend had said. The horror and cruelty and
yet the excitement of the scene before her was
holding all her attention.</p>

<p>Down there before her the bullfighter was
fighting a championship fight. He was playing
with the bull, teasing him toward him and then
skillfully dancing away. The end was imminent.
The fighter was waiting only for an opportunity
to make the clean, quick plunge that would finish
the fight with one stroke.</p>

<p>Now, the moment seemed near and everyone,
Nan and her friends, and the more than twenty
thousand other people in the great ring stood up,
cheering for the finish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The fighter closed in and then drew back to
make the lunge, but there was blood on the ground
beneath his feet and he slipped. The bull gave a
mighty roar and went toward him, his horns lowered.
The fight had turned. There could be only
one possible end now. Death for the fighter.</p>

<p>But wait. That fighter is clever. He gracefully
pulls aside so the menacing horns glance across
his arm. He jumps up from the ground, pulls his
arm back, and before the bull has had a chance to
recover from his surprise, that fighter is, with one
mighty thrust, plunging the spear straight through
the bull&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>There, it&rsquo;s over now. The fighter has fought the
fight that will surely bring him the trophy, a pair
of little gold ears. The throng, wild with excitement,
throws hats, scarfs, pillows, everything
loose that it can lay its hands on into the ring as
the hero of the hour slowly walks around and
bows with arms thrown out wide as though to
embrace the whole cheering multitude.</p>

<p>Everything is gay and happy now. Even the
man that follows after the hero and picks up the
hats, scarfs, and pillows that litter the ground and
tosses them lightly back to the owners above is
laughing. Yes, even the man that pushed the
wheelbarrow in the grand opening procession is
happy, basking in reflected glory, as he trundles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his burden around the ring, sprinkling sawdust
over the blood spots.</p>

<p>It was not until the monosabios, &ldquo;wise monkeys&rdquo;,
came to drag out the bull, destined now for
food for a nearby hospital, that Bess again tried
to attract Nan&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, I tell you that that&rsquo;s Linda Riggs down
there below us,&rdquo; she said insistently this time.
&ldquo;Look at the way she&rsquo;s tossing her head and talking
to that man that&rsquo;s next to her. You would
think that he was a prince, a handsome prince, the
way she is acting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess, you&rsquo;re right. That is Linda.&rdquo; Nan
at last drew her eyes away from the ring and
looked at the girl Bess was pointing to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m sure she saw us a while ago,&rdquo;
Laura contributed. She too had been watching the
girl that the Lakeview crowd had grown to dislike
so cordially. &ldquo;You know the way she always
looks around her to see whether there is anyone
she really ought to be decent to, anyone that
might be able to do something for her. Well, she
did that when she first came in. I saw her, but I
wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything because I didn&rsquo;t want
to spoil the fun we were having.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet she sneered when she saw us,&rdquo; Bess
said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always hated us and especially since
we had the laugh on her on the boat last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, that wasn&rsquo;t exactly a laugh,&rdquo; Nan
protested. &ldquo;The girl almost drowned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you went and saved her. And what
thanks did you get?&rdquo; Bess could always be indignant
when she thought of Linda Riggs. &ldquo;You
should have let her alone. I would have. I would
have enjoyed seeing the waves wash her over-board.
I would have looked over the rail and
laughed when I saw her screaming and waving
her arms and trying to keep herself from going
under.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You little fiend!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;How can
you say such things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they are true,&rdquo; Bess retorted. &ldquo;People
like her shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to clutter up
things. She makes everybody that knows her unhappy,
so what good is she anyway? Her father
is always trying to get her out of trouble. Look at
her down there now. You can see by the way she&rsquo;s
holding her head that she&rsquo;s mean and proud and
deceitful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, be quiet!&rdquo; Nan warned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
everyone looking at you. Linda is a little prig and
she does make trouble and I don&rsquo;t like her any
more than you do, but there&rsquo;s no use making
things unpleasant because she&rsquo;s happened to turn
up here where we are. Forget her.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget her!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t forget
a thorn that&rsquo;s forever sticking in your flesh.
Trying to forget her doesn&rsquo;t do any good. She
always makes trouble. It&rsquo;s best to watch her so
that you will be prepared for what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps Bess was right. Certainly, if at other
times Nan and Bess had been more watchful they
might have been able to avoid trouble. But Nan
always believed that there was some good in
everyone and she was always trustful. She felt
often that Linda, because of her wealth and the
fact that her mother was dead and her father
tried to give her everything she wanted, was not
entirely to blame for her actions. And Bess, well,
Bess&rsquo;s attitude toward Linda had changed considerably
since their first meeting.</p>

<p>Then Bess had thought that the daughter of
the railroad magnate would be a nice person to
have for a friend, for Bess was decidedly impressed
by her wealth, by the way she ordered
people around, and the way she dressed. Bess had
even written home in the first days at school and
told her mother that she didn&rsquo;t have at all the
proper kind of clothes to wear, if she was going
to chum around with people that amounted to
something. She had Linda in mind when she wrote
it, Linda&rsquo;s clothes and Linda&rsquo;s social position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
But Linda had soon shown Bess that there was
no room for her in her world.</p>

<p>Girls that Linda called friend, if there was any
such word in her vocabulary, had to bow to all her
wishes. She liked them only if they thought everything
she did and said was right. No girl could be
her friend and have a will of her own. No girl
could be her friend and have other friends too.
Linda wanted to be the very center of everyone&rsquo;s
attention. As a consequence she had no real
friends at all.</p>

<p>Bess never analyzed this to herself, but after
one or two attempts to go around with Linda,
she gave up entirely and grew to dislike her very
much, as all the readers of the Nan Sherwood
series know. She disliked her particularly because
of the mean things she had done to Nan, for if
Bess had no other outstanding characteristic, she
did have a sense of justice that was almost as
strong as Nan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This she had although her sympathies were not
as deep nor as understanding as Nan&rsquo;s. Bess was
apt to accept or reject things and people on account
of appearances. Nan never did this. She
liked everyone and had always had some sort of
sixth sense that made her look beneath surfaces
and find the true person. Thus she made friends
with all sorts of people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the reason that Nan led such an adventurous
life. This was the reason everyone liked
her. Everyone called Linda snobbish. A few people
called Bess the same. But no one ever thought
of applying the word to Nan.</p>

<p>And Nan seldom talked about people. So now,
as the girls sat in the arena in Mexico City waiting
for the next bullfighter to come into the ring,
Nan was doing her best to quiet her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason whatsoever to get so excited,&rdquo;
she said in an undertone to Bess. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
sitting way down below us so we won&rsquo;t have to
even talk to her when we go out. We&rsquo;ll be up the
stairs and out the exit before she does. We&rsquo;ll
probably never even see her again while we&rsquo;re
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Laura agreed, talking in a
whisper too. &ldquo;And though you might think that
you could prepare yourself for what might happen
if you did encounter Linda, you never could.
No one ever knows what that girl might do. And,
Elizabeth Harley, you&rsquo;re not smart enough to
guess.&rdquo; Laura being Laura with her red hair and
her love for battle couldn&rsquo;t resist adding this
thrust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I could try anyway,&rdquo; Bess retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you people all talking about so
quietly?&rdquo; Amelia leaned over and asked now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, you didn&rsquo;t even pay any attention when
Mr. Jamieson took Grace out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Took Grace out!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, noticing
now for the first time that two in the party were
missing. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She almost fainted when she saw all the blood
streaming from the bull, so just before he was
killed, Walker Jamieson took her by the arm and
said they were going for a walk and would be
back soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; Bess said emphatically.
&ldquo;I would have fainted myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;if you had been watching the bullfight instead
of Linda Riggs,&rdquo; Nan supplied the end of
the sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right,&rdquo; Bess laughed. &ldquo;That
girl certainly does have a habit of getting in my
hair. I&rsquo;m always on pins and needles whenever
she is around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Bessie,&rdquo; Nan tried to smooth her
friend&rsquo;s ruffled feelings. &ldquo;Just you sit quietly and
watch the next fight and you&rsquo;ll feel better. We&rsquo;ll
see that Linda doesn&rsquo;t cross your path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t better,&rdquo; Bess replied and then did
try to devote herself to watching the next fight
on the program.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A HASTY DEPARTURE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Sit quietly and watch a bullfight!&rdquo; Adair
MacKenzie had heard Nan&rsquo;s counsel to Bess.
&ldquo;Never heard of such a thing. Never saw such a
thing happen. Couldn&rsquo;t possibly sit quietly and
watch a bullfight. Too exciting. Too much blood
and gore. No place to bring a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adair had been upset by Grace&rsquo;s fainting spell
and now he was sorry he had ever brought the
girls here. Already he was casting about in his
mind for something else to do that would wipe
the memory of the unpleasantness of the spectacle
out of their minds. He was oblivious of the fact
that none of them outside of perhaps Nan and
Amelia had witnessed the fight with their whole
attention. He didn&rsquo;t yet know the story of Linda.
The fact that her presence distracted them consequently
had gone unobserved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got your things? Come on. We&rsquo;re going
now.&rdquo; Abruptly he made up his mind and plunged
into action without further ado.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But father,&rdquo; Alice demurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;but&rsquo; me,&rdquo; Adair answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to get out of this outlandish place right
away. Can&rsquo;t have you all fainting on my hands.
Ready?&rdquo; He was already halfway out the row
and effectively blocking the view of the ring of
all the people who had seats behind his party. But
it didn&rsquo;t matter to him. In fact, he was so concerned
with his own immediate problem that no
one else in the world existed. Now he turned
around again to see if the girls were following
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine spectacle for civilized people to put on,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;Hurry, you people. Can&rsquo;t be all
day getting out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; The voice that agreed with him
was an American voice and it startled him. Adair
looked up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked the question
gruffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s right,&rsquo;&rdquo; the stranger answered.
He was sitting about three rows behind where
Adair was standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Adair looked more
belligerent than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean you can&rsquo;t be all day getting out of
here.&rdquo; The voice in back answered positively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-w-why, you old&mdash;old&mdash;old,&rdquo; Adair spluttered.
He could think of no epithet appropriate
and yet forceful enough to call his critic in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
presence of the girls. So his spluttering died away
as he brandished his cane and just stood and
looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy, daddy,&rdquo; Alice put a soft hand on his
arm. &ldquo;Do come. We are blocking the view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to see down there anyway,&rdquo; Adair
returned. &ldquo;These Americans,&rdquo; he went on talking
loudly and looking back at the man above him,
&ldquo;come down here and think they can run everything.
Want to tell us to move on. Who do they
think they are anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh, daddy.&rdquo; Alice was worried for fear her
father would start a fight, even while she was
secretly amused that he was accusing a fellow
countryman of doing the very thing that he was
guilty of. &ldquo;We must get down and out so that we
can find how Grace is,&rdquo; she added tactfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hurrying just as fast as these Mexicans
will let me,&rdquo; Adair answered. &ldquo;I always said
they were the slowest, most inconsiderate people
in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adair was wrong in what he said, and he knew
it. As he was now sputtering about them being
inconsiderate, so often he had sputtered because
of their patient consideration for other people.
Then he had said that they were too polite.</p>

<p>However, Adair prided himself on his willingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to change his mind. &ldquo;Only dunces never contradict
themselves,&rdquo; he often said.</p>

<p>Now, Alice and the girls were themselves moving
along as fast as they could behind him, so,
though he continued to mutter and even brandish
his cane at others whom he suspected of calling
at him in Spanish, he was soon safely out in the
aisle and they all hurried up the stairs and out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-o-ooh, but that was close,&rdquo; Laura&rsquo;s eyes
were dancing at the recollection of the scene in
the stands as she and Nan stepped out into the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it though?&rdquo; Nan was laughing too,
now, though at the time, she, like Alice, had been
worried for fear Adair would come to blows with
the American.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two Americans come to blows at a bullfight,&rdquo;
Laura said, &ldquo;and the bullfight is forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was afraid of,&rdquo; Nan whispered.
&ldquo;These people in this country are so hot-headed
that I was afraid there would be a general
riot, before we got out of there. They were all
worked up so over the first fight that they would
have entered our private little fray without any
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought too,&rdquo; Laura agreed.
&ldquo;And did you see the expression on Bess&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nan returned, &ldquo;but I can just imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
what it was like. She hates scenes of any kind. I
do too, but this one was almost funny. Cousin
Adair is so quick tempered that he glides in and
out of trouble with the greatest of ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he though?&rdquo; Amelia contributed. &ldquo;It
fascinates me when I see one of his explosions
coming. Every time he opens his mouth, he gets
in deeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is funny when you see it happen to someone
else,&rdquo; Laura agreed somewhat ruefully. &ldquo;But
when it happens to you, if you have a sensitive
soul, like mine, it&rsquo;s pretty embarrassing.&rdquo; Laura
was in earnest, for her quick tongue often did its
work before she had a chance to stop it. &ldquo;Oh
Laura,&rdquo; her mother had more than once shaken
her head over her daughter&rsquo;s failing, &ldquo;you need
to count to a hundred at least when you feel your
cheeks flushing and your head getting hot with
anger. And you need to button your mouth up
tight, or you&rsquo;ll always be terribly unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura thought of this now, and giggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s so funny,&rdquo; Bess
remarked. She still felt irritated at what had happened.
&ldquo;Maybe if you had seen Linda Riggs looking
around at us, you wouldn&rsquo;t be giggling the
way you are. I wish I could have just gone right
through that floor.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was concrete and you couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Laura
pretended to be very practical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, not without hurting herself,&rdquo; Amelia
appended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t funny.&rdquo; Bess was genuinely upset.
She would have hated the scene anyway, and when
it occurred in Linda&rsquo;s presence, she hated it doubly.
&ldquo;You should have seen the look of pity and
disgust and triumph on her face when she saw
that it was our party that was making all the
fuss,&rdquo; Bess went on, growing more vehement the
more she talked. &ldquo;It was positively humiliating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than any of the others, Bess cared about
what other people thought of her. Always conscious
of herself and eager to make a good impression,
she was always upset when things went
wrong at all. When they did not run just according
to the way she thought they should, in public
especially, she felt like hiding her head and running.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I am and I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she
retorted once when Nan accused her of being
over-sensitive, and so she never made the proper
effort to overcome her failing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who cares what Linda thinks?&rdquo; Laura said
airily as Walker and Grace joined the party, and
the incident was forgotten, for the moment, while
everyone made a fuss over Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a sissy,&rdquo; Laura teased. &ldquo;See a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
little bit of blood and you go off in a faint. What
will you do when we start dissecting things in
biology at school next fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Grace looked worried as
though she was going to have to do the dissecting
right away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! We&rsquo;ll worry about that when the
time comes,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie answered as
though it was his problem to be handled in due
course. &ldquo;How are you now?&rdquo; He looked at Grace
closely while he asked the question. &ldquo;Feeling all
right again, are you?&rdquo; He spoke gently, as he
might have spoken to Alice, his daughter, and a
warm feeling of sympathy toward him went
through all those standing around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Nan said afterward, and Bess had to
agree, &ldquo;I believe he was irritable up in the stands
because he was worried about Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; Bess was much less tolerant of
other people&rsquo;s failings than her friend. &ldquo;But that
was no excuse for him to get all riled up. I can&rsquo;t
forget the way Linda looked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bessie, forget it.&rdquo; Nan spoke sharply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not important at all. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what Linda
thinks of us. And it is important that we not criticise
Cousin Adair. After all, we are his guests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; Bess agreed. She could, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
occasion, be generous in yielding when she knew
she was in the wrong.</p>

<p>As they talked these things over, the whole
party walked toward the waiting car. Again, it
was a voice from the United States that arrested
them, but one more softly spoken than that they
had heard in the grandstands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; it said. Nan and her
Lakeview Hall companions looked up startled.
The speaker who had accosted them was accompanied
by none other than Linda Riggs!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>LINDA PERFORMS AN INTRODUCTION</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo; Linda Riggs&rsquo; companion
spoke again, &ldquo;but could you direct us to Avenida
Chapultepec?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before anyone could answer Linda rushed over
to Nan and took her by the arm. &ldquo;Why, Nancy
Sherwood!&rdquo; she exclaimed as though Nan was the
best friend she had in the world. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so surprised
to see you here. When did you arrive?
Isn&rsquo;t this city just perfectly gorgeous? More
quaint, don&rsquo;t you think, than anything we saw in
Europe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was at a loss as to what to say. Deep within
her she was entirely out of patience with the
situation. Linda was being disgustedly affected.
She was talking slowly, dragging her vowels and
gesturing with her hands, acting as a person twice
her age might act and even then be nauseous. But
Linda disregarded Nan&rsquo;s coolness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Bess,&rdquo; Linda turned to Elizabeth
Harley. &ldquo;Imagine seeing you here. Isn&rsquo;t it all too
romantic for words, a whole crowd of Lakeview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Hall people meeting in this far-off corner of the
globe. The most astounding things do happen,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; Laura remarked dryly, looking
Linda up and down as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Laura Polk. Why, you are all together,
I do believe.&rdquo; Linda acted as though she
had made a brilliant observation. She was having
a difficult time, even for her, in the situation, for
her effusions were being received rather coldly to
say the least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you meet my friend, Arthur
Howard,&rdquo; she went on, forcing Nan to introduce
her and her companion to her cousin and Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm! Glad to meet you.&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
said abruptly. &ldquo;Got to be going now. Sorry, don&rsquo;t
know the way to Avenida whatever-it-was-you-said.
Can&rsquo;t keep any of these streets straight in my
mind. They&rsquo;re all mixed up.&rdquo; With this, he summarily
herded his daughter, Nan, Laura, Bess,
and Amelia toward the car where Walker Jamieson
and Grace who had gone on alone together
were waiting. Linda and her companion were thus
left behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; Grace hardly waited until the girls
were in the car beside her before she asked the
question, &ldquo;was that Linda Riggs that you were
talking to out there?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;None other,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;And why are
you giggling so, Bess. A few moments ago you
were all hot and bothered about Linda and now
you&rsquo;re laughing. Will you please make up your
mind about what you&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so funny.&rdquo; Bess was off again. &ldquo;Did
you see the way she looked when Mr. MacKenzie
walked away so suddenly. I do believe that she
thought we would fall all over her the way she
was falling all over us. Oh, dear, did that do my
heart good!&rdquo; Bess sounded positively gleeful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine too.&rdquo; Laura was laughing with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you remember,&rdquo; Bess went on, &ldquo;how,
when Mr. MacKenzie analyzed all of us when he
first met us, we wished that some day he would
have the chance to do it to Linda. Well, that wish
almost came true down there. I do believe that if
we had stayed a moment longer he would have
done it. I was hoping&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Harley! I thought you didn&rsquo;t like
Cousin Adair,&rdquo; Nan, too, was tickled at the whole
situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do now,&rdquo; Bess capitulated. &ldquo;I just love
him. Do you know that&rsquo;s the first time since we&rsquo;ve
known her, that we&rsquo;ve seen her as embarrassed
as she makes us sometimes. How I wish we had
stayed just a moment longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about your just loving someone?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Adair turned around to join in the conversation.</p>

<p>Bess blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is,&rdquo; he went on when she
failed to answer. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not that girl back
there that we just met that you&rsquo;re being so enthusiastic
about. Don&rsquo;t like her at all myself. No
character. She&rsquo;s snippy. She&rsquo;s deceitful. Can&rsquo;t even
talk without putting on airs. Can&rsquo;t stand her.
Hope she&rsquo;s no friend of yours.&rdquo; He turned to Nan
as he said this last.</p>

<p>Nan shook her head and said nothing further.
She felt, and rightly so, that it was unnecessary to
discuss Linda among people who did not know
her. This was a consideration that Linda would
never have shown Nan. In fact, time and again,
Linda had purposely attempted to blacken Nan&rsquo;s
character in front of strangers. This was one reason
that Bess, loyal as she was to Nan, disliked
Linda so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tolerate people who are affected,&rdquo;
Adair MacKenzie went on blustering as the car
drove out into the street. &ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t like that
man she was with either. He didn&rsquo;t have a very
honest look about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was nice-looking.&rdquo; Bess let the words
out before she realized what she was doing, and
the wrath of Adair MacKenzie descended upon
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice-looking! That&rsquo;s all you think of. Nice-looking,
bah! Can&rsquo;t judge people by their looks.
It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in their eyes and their hearts that
counts. Have to see that before you can accurately
decide what they are. Anybody can dress up and
make a good appearance. You, Bessie,&rdquo; he lowered
his tone at a look from Alice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
to learn something about true values before you
get much older. You&rsquo;re a nice sort of girl, but you
put too much emphasis on money and worldly
goods. You&rsquo;ll have to be taught sometime that
they are not so important as you think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That goes for all of you,&rdquo; he ended, sweeping
them all with his glance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all had easy
lives, so you don&rsquo;t know yet, really, what&rsquo;s worth
while and what isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that girl back there,&rdquo; he resumed his
talk after a few moments of silence, &ldquo;she has no
conception what-so-ever of worth. What&rsquo;s her
name, anyway?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda Riggs,&rdquo; Nan answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the daughter of the railroad king?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Nan nodded her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knew him, when he was a young fellow,&rdquo;
Adair paused, remembering his own youth. &ldquo;He
was a nice chap then. Can&rsquo;t understand how he
could have reared such a poor excuse for a daughter.
We belonged to the same college fraternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
He was president of it at one time I think. Always
helping people out. Everybody liked him.
That&rsquo;s how he happened to get on in the world
the way he did. Met up with someone who had
lots of dough and no son to carry on the family
name. Riggs seemed to fill the bill, so the wealthy
old codger took him into his business and
taught him the ropes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Riggs wore well, and when the old man died
he inherited the fortune. Sounds like a fairy story,
but those things happen. Jamieson here must know
the tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Do. Interviewed
the old bird one time under particularly
difficult circumstances. There was a big railroad
merger story about to break, and nobody wanted
to talk. I got wind of it through a hot tip from a
stooge in New York. Tried everything in order
to get the story, and finally in desperation went
to Riggs himself. It was rumored that he had the
controlling interest in the stock. I had to go
through a dozen secretaries before I finally got
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he didn&rsquo;t want to talk either. However,
some little thing I said in passing, captured his
fancy, and before I knew it, I was laying all my
cards on the table and he was putting them together
so that they made sense. When we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
finished, I realized that I had one of the biggest
stories of the year and was about to grab my hat
and run out to put it on the wires, when he put out
a restraining hand. &lsquo;Sorry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I must
ask you to keep this quiet for twenty-four hours
longer. If you promise, I assure you that no one
else will get the release until your paper has the
scoop all sewed up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a way I was up a tree, because I knew that
if the story had leaked out to me, someone else
was very likely to get wind of it too. I hesitated.
He stuck out his hand as though to shake mine
and he did it in such a frank friendly fashion, that
I agreed to what he asked, even though I knew it was
a dumb thing to do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there was something about the man that
inspired confidence and regard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lived up to the agreement, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Adair
said positively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure did,&rdquo; Walker assented, &ldquo;and under difficulty
too. Just as I suspected, some other paper
did get wind of the story and sent one of their
ace men out to get the details. Riggs let him in,
quizzed him to find out what he knew, excused
himself, and then called me to tell me that the
time was up, that I&rsquo;d better shoot the yarn right
through if I wanted to scoop the rest of the
dailies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after he did that, he went back into his
office and told the other reporter the whole story
he had told me. It took him three hours to tell it,
and when my competitor came out of the office
our extras were already on the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the Midwestern merger, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Adair questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Jamieson agreed. &ldquo;Remember it,
don&rsquo;t you? But you chits,&rdquo; he turned his attention
to the girls who had been listening with their customary
attention to his tale, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t remember.
You were hardly out of your cradles
then. Nan here was probably still creeping around
in rompers. Bess, well, Bess probably didn&rsquo;t creep,
that was too dirty for her, but she was probably
beginning to put her hands up to her father and
saying, &lsquo;gimme&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brought a laugh from everyone, including
Adair MacKenzie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he returned to the question
of Linda, &ldquo;how a girl with a father like Riggs
could be such an obnoxious person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are lots of explanations,&rdquo; Walker
answered. &ldquo;I happen to know that his wife died
when the girl was just a baby. He was all broken
up and turned to the child for comfort. Guess he
lavished all his attention on her and spoiled her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds plausible,&rdquo; Adair agreed, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
looked at Alice. &ldquo;See how I ruined my daughter
with kindness,&rdquo; he twitted. &ldquo;Let her get out of
hand completely. Now I can&rsquo;t do anything with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to get rid of her?&rdquo; Walker winked at
Alice, as he asked the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Adair was startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, dad,&rdquo; Alice frowned at Walker.
&ldquo;Where are we going now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Adair took out his watch as he
shook his head. He frowned. &ldquo;Guess we can make
it though,&rdquo; he continued, laughing with the others
at his own inconsistency.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>FLOATING GARDENS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Xochimilco or place of flowers. How lovely,&rdquo;
Nan spoke softly in the presence of the beauty
before her.</p>

<p>Adair MacKenzie in his desire to introduce the
girls to something that would make them forget
the bullfight had brought them to one of the
prettiest places in all Mexico. Now, he was looking
exceedingly pleased with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, daddy,&rdquo; Alice too was thrilled at the
spectacle before them. &ldquo;Many, many times I&rsquo;ve
heard of the floating gardens of Mexico and I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there they are,&rdquo; Adair said as off-handedly
as possible under the circumstances. &ldquo;Now
you see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed at his matter-of-factness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will allow me,&rdquo; Walker Jamieson who
had deserted the party immediately after the car
had been parked, now brought a canoe he had
rented and paddled up one of the many canals
before them to a stop at their feet. He stood up
and held out his arm to Alice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair lady, you come first.&rdquo; He said as he
helped her in and assisted her to a seat opposite
him. &ldquo;And now, Nan.&rdquo; So one after the other he
helped the members of the party to places in the
large canoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-h-hm,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie cleared his throat
as he seated his bulk. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;d say this is more
in keeping with what young ladies should like.
How about it?&rdquo; He addressed his question to
Grace who was beaming beside him.</p>

<p>She nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Everyone was completely happy as Walker
pushed the canoe off. So the rest of the afternoon
was whiled away in paddling lazily through the
flower-bordered canals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are they called floating gardens?&rdquo; Nan
addressed her question to Walker who seemed a
fountainhead of information about all sorts of
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply because they float,&rdquo; Walker answered
as he disentangled his paddle from some lily stems
along the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t actually see them move,&rdquo; Nan
said as she peered earnestly at one of the many
islands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t, now,&rdquo; Walker agreed. &ldquo;But
there was a time, Miss Curiosity, ages ago when
these beautiful gardens actually did float from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
place to place, a time when you didn&rsquo;t know from
one day to the next just where you&rsquo;d wake up and
find a certain particularly beautiful one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The subject was an intriguing one and
Nan wanted to know all about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they say,&rdquo; Walker continued quietly, &ldquo;that
the earth of the gardens lies on interlacing twigs.
Naturally before the water filled in as it is now,
these twigs moved with the current and carried
their burden of earth and flowers along with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was always a beautiful spot,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;even back before the Aztecs found the
eagle on the cactus and conquered the region and
settled their capitol. When they did all this and
found themselves with leisure on their hands, the
nobles made of this place a playground, and the
Aztec papa and mama came here with the Aztec
child for Sunday picnics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, if I hadn&rsquo;t been as energetic as I am,&rdquo;
he paused and grinned at the snort that this
brought forth from Alice&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;a descendant
of these same Aztecs, who still, by the way, speaks
the tongue of his forefathers, would have been
plying this gondola. The Aztecs still live around
here and still preserve many of the ancient customs
of their people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rested the paddle on the side of the canoe
as he finished and, as water dripped from it making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
little rings in the canal, he sat idly dreaming.
The canoe drifted along and came to rest under
an over-hanging willow. No one spoke. It was a
magic moment, for the sun was setting and sending
low rays over the water. Tropical birds were
singing full-throated songs and in the distance
they could hear, faintly, the sound of music.</p>

<p>Finally, Alice spoke. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be very different,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;than it was centuries ago. For
the same exotic flowers ran wild here then that
do now, and the same birds sang. How queer that
makes me feel. Century after century has unrolled
and yet this is the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Walker looked across at her.
&ldquo;Makes you feel, doesn&rsquo;t it, that time isn&rsquo;t so important
after all, that a philosophy in which
&lsquo;mañana&rsquo; is the all-important word is perhaps not
such a bad one after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, here,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie broke the
spell. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go preaching that mañana business
to these girls. They are lazy enough as it is. Look
at them now, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In truth, the girls did all look comfortable and
lazy, entirely at peace with themselves and the
world and not at all like the busy energetic beings
that they were at school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world doesn&rsquo;t seem real, does it?&rdquo; Nan
looked at Bess as she made this observation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bess answered. &ldquo;Not real at all. This,
I believe, is the most romantic spot we have ever
been in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nan agreed idly, and for some reason
or other her thoughts drifted back towards home
and school and then to Walter, Grace&rsquo;s brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to tell you,&rdquo; Grace broke
in on her train of thought as though she knew
what had been going on in Nan&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Mother
said in that letter I got at Wells Fargo&rsquo;s this
morning that she had consented to let Walter go
on a motor trip through the West and Mexico
with his Spanish teacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s voice betrayed her interest, and
she was conscious as she spoke that all the girls
were suddenly more alert. The piece of news was
one they were interested in too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; Grace went on, pleased that she
had the attention of everyone, &ldquo;that every year
he takes a group down through this district so
that they can hear Spanish spoken by the people
whose tongue it is. Walter likes Spanish and so
he&rsquo;s going along with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will he be here,&rdquo; Bess asked the question
which she knew Nan wanted to ask but
wouldn&rsquo;t in face of the interest that everyone was
showing in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother wasn&rsquo;t sure,&rdquo; Grace answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&ldquo;It all depends on so many things. They&rsquo;ll be
gone the whole summer and will linger at the
places the boys seem to like the best. It seems that
the teacher leaves the itinerary almost entirely
up to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like fun.&rdquo; Nan tried to be casual and
general as she spoke, but she didn&rsquo;t altogether
succeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie
had caught the drift of the conversation. &ldquo;Who
is this Walter anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Grace&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; Nan answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Adair was not to be put off so easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he went with us to Rose Ranch a few
summers ago and met us in London with Grace&rsquo;s
mother and dad last year.&rdquo; Nan thought it would
be better for her to answer the questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m. Think I understand.&rdquo; Adair appeared
to be devoting much thought to this
&ldquo;understanding&rdquo; business for he said nothing
further for a while. Finally, as though he suddenly
remembered what they had been talking
about, he returned to the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t the young hoodlums&mdash;I have no
doubt but what they are young hoodlums, all boys
are&mdash;stop at the hacienda with us for a few
days?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Grace&rsquo;s face beamed at this. &ldquo;Why, how nice!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
she exclaimed, &ldquo;but just think, there will be five
of them at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; Adair dismissed this as an objection.
&ldquo;Got lots of room. We&rsquo;ll make a party
of it when they come and serve them a real Mexican
meal.&rdquo; Adair seemed to have forgotten entirely
that he personally despised Mexican cooking.
&ldquo;Hot tamales, tortillas, everything.&rdquo; He
waved his hand grandly as though the whole world
would be at the disposal of the boys for the
asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like boys anyway,&rdquo; Adair went on. &ldquo;Girls
are a nuisance. Always fainting. Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter,&rdquo; he glossed over this last part of conversation
as he saw the blood mounting to Grace&rsquo;s
cheeks. &ldquo;Just like to have boys around.&rdquo; He ended
rather weakly. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see. It&rsquo;s getting pretty
dark, better move on.&rdquo; He motioned to Walker
who obediently took the paddle in hand and began
the leisurely journey back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>GOOD-BY TO MEXICO CITY</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, yesterday was a grand day!&rdquo; Nan
stretched her arms wide and high as she sat up
in her bed the next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Bess rolled over in her bed
and looked at Nan. &ldquo;It was just full of surprises.
I don&rsquo;t know what I liked the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Nan said promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Adair. I think he&rsquo;s a darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d probably roar a mighty roar if he heard
you say that,&rdquo; Bess laughed at the prospect, &ldquo;but
you know, I quite agree with you, even if it isn&rsquo;t
my friend that he has invited to stop at the
hacienda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Walter&rsquo;s a friend to all of us,&rdquo; Nan
protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course,&rdquo; Bess agreed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
friend to all of us and a particular friend to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bessie, if this big pillow wasn&rsquo;t so soft,&rdquo; Nan
looked at the pillow she was holding in her hand
speculatively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d heave it over at you so fast that
you wouldn&rsquo;t know what had struck you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Nancy,&rdquo; Bess laughed. &ldquo;I
understand. You don&rsquo;t like to be teased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it fun last night?&rdquo; Nan changed the
subject completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was fun?&rdquo; Bess could remember so
many nice things that she really didn&rsquo;t know which
one Nan was talking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner on the bank of the canal at Xochimilco,&rdquo;
Nan answered promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget it.
The lights. The flowers. The music. Who would
ever think to look at him and hear him talk that
Cousin Adair would be romantic enough to think
up anything like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo; Bess idly watched an insect that
was buzzing around the room. &ldquo;I was much surprised.
Then I began to wonder if it wasn&rsquo;t
Walker Jamieson&rsquo;s idea after all. You know he
has a clever way of suggesting things to your
cousin, so that when your cousin decides what to
do it appears as though he thought up the idea
originally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess.&rdquo; Nan appeared to be horrified at
the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know it&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; Bess looked over at
Nan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lots of fun to watch him do it. Do you
know, sometimes I think that he&rsquo;s almost clever
enough to make Mr. MacKenzie think that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
idea of his marrying Alice was his, Mr. MacKenzie&rsquo;s
I mean, originally. Do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, if you don&rsquo;t stop speculating about that,
I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do to you.&rdquo; Nan
laughed. &ldquo;You know you might spoil everything
by talking about it,&rdquo; she ended seriously. &ldquo;For
all you know the idea has never once entered
Walker Jamieson&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess hooted at this. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever think
that,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;because it isn&rsquo;t true and
you know it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you two people doing in bed at
this hour?&rdquo; Laura stuck her head in the doorway
and inquired. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that it&rsquo;s long past
time to get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bed&rsquo;s so nice,&rdquo; Nan answered, &ldquo;I just hate
to get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is,&rdquo; Laura finished before
she closed the door, &ldquo;the temperature downstairs
is slightly chilly, and if you know what&rsquo;s good for
you, you&rsquo;ll be out of there in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right-o.&rdquo; Nan jumped up at this bit of information.
&ldquo;Hi! Laura,&rdquo; she called after her
friend, &ldquo;come back here a minute. Was there any
mail this morning,&rdquo; she asked as Laura&rsquo;s red head
reappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for us,&rdquo; Laura answered, &ldquo;but your
cousin got something that made him blow up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you to hurry. I gather
from certain orders I overheard him giving the
chauffeur that he wants to start immediately, if
not sooner, for the hacienda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Bess asked, as she too jumped out of
bed. &ldquo;You mean we are going to leave Mexico
City today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the impression I&rsquo;m trying hard to convey,&rdquo;
Laura responded. &ldquo;And I think that if you
two lugs want any breakfast at all, you better get
a hustle on.&rdquo; With this she closed the door definitely
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Nan and Bess hurried as they
had not hurried for a long time. &ldquo;Getting ready
for an early morning class in the winter has nothing
on this,&rdquo; Bess laughed as she tied a bright
three-cornered scarf around her neck and pulled it
in place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nan agreed, quickly tying
the laces in her white oxfords. &ldquo;A lick and a
promise and we&rsquo;re ready to go.&rdquo; With this she
bounded across the room and opened the door
wide for her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such energy!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed as though horrified.
She was never one to be as exuberant as
Nan. She was always more dignified and more
correct. Nan was more natural and more full of
fun. She did what she liked to do, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
part, simply because it was fun. Bess was more
apt to do things because other people did them.
Nan was a leader, and Bess, the follower. That
was, perhaps, the reason they had been friends
for so long. They were alike in some respects, but
totally different in others.</p>

<p>Now, as they came down the broad stairway
of the big hotel lobby together, this difference
was most plain. Adair MacKenzie, pacing up and
down the lobby even as he did in his office when
he was at work, stopped to look at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get by,&rdquo; he thought with satisfaction as
he noted Nan&rsquo;s bright face and free, graceful
walk. &ldquo;&rsquo;bout time you two made your appearance,&rdquo;
he said aloud and assumed a grim appearance.
&ldquo;Finished a day&rsquo;s work myself already.
Guess it&rsquo;s another to get you people started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Started?&rdquo; Nan questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stay here all the time.&rdquo; Adair answered
her question. &ldquo;Anyway, I just got word that the
housekeeper is arriving tomorrow and I&rsquo;ve got to
get down there and have things straightened
around before she puts in an appearance. These
ornery housekeepers, you know, have to be babied.
If you don&rsquo;t, they leave every time you turn
around. Someday, someone will invent a robot
that will do the work, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have a housekeeper to scold anymore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
daddy,&rdquo; Alice interrupted and finished for
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve her right,&rdquo; Adair answered as though
the housekeeper would be the loser. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see
that she&rsquo;s any good anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson joined
the rest in the lobby. He had been out for an early
morning walk and looked fresh and full of life as
he came in. &ldquo;Got your camera, Nan?&rdquo; he turned
to her when he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; Nan answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a few pictures,&rdquo; Walker suggested.
In the face of Adair&rsquo;s morning state, this seemed
a daring thing to suggest, and Nan looked at
Adair to see his reaction. He seemed not to be
listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run along,&rdquo; Alice gave Nan a little shove.
&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s going to be busy for the next half hour
or so, finishing up some business here, so if we
hurry, we can take all the pictures we want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Nan did go upstairs for her camera.
She was anxious enough to, but she had hesitated
because she never liked to be the one to arouse
her cousin.</p>

<p>Now, she almost petted the camera as she returned
with it. She loved it and was already looking
forward to the day when she could own one
herself, for she had made up her mind, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Walker had been giving her instructions to learn
all she possibly could about taking pictures. This
was the reason she took pictures of everyone and
everything she saw until Walker declared that the
authorities would be questioning her on suspicion
that she was a spy of some sort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, a spy?&rdquo; Nan laughed at the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you do look harmless,&rdquo; Walker agreed,
&ldquo;but then strange things do happen, especially to
people who spend all their time taking pictures.
How many have you got now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nan laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, &lsquo;fess up&rsquo;,&rdquo; Walker urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see there must be a dozen rolls upstairs,&rdquo;
Nan admitted. &ldquo;It will cost a fortune to develop
them, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to my buying some developer
and pans and whatever else is needed and taking
them along to the hacienda with us?&rdquo; Walker
asked. &ldquo;We could develop all your films there
then, for practically nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; Nan agreed enthusiastically,
&ldquo;but I thought you had some big story you were
going to work on down there.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, that can wait.&rdquo;
Walker Jamieson acted as though stories did wait
for people and laughed at himself while he did it.
&ldquo;Anyway it will only take a jiffy to teach you all
I know about the photography business.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; Nan agreed.</p>

<p>So it came about that Nan and Walker went to
the hacienda supplied with everything to develop
pictures. How fortunate this was! But then that
story belongs to later chapters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, eagle eye, how&rsquo;s the camera working
this morning?&rdquo; Laura inquired as Nan and
Walker went out into the lovely patio of their
hotel. &ldquo;Want to take some pictures of me draped
around one of those tall white pillars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do one of you strung from that balcony, up
there, kid,&rdquo; Walker offered generously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, kind sir,&rdquo; Laura replied graciously,
&ldquo;but since I&rsquo;m going to need my neck for
a little while longer, I must refuse&mdash;with regret
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On second thought, perhaps that is best,&rdquo;
Walker agreed. &ldquo;It would be a shame to spoil
this lovely scene this fine morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pretty, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Nan looked about her
with great satisfaction. The patio or courtyard so
familiar to Spain is a part of the Mexican scene
too, and this one where Nan was taking pictures
was particularly lovely with its gay flowers, deep
green foliage, and pond all surrounded by the
pinkish colored walls of the hotel itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I hate to leave all this,&rdquo; Nan remarked
when the pictures were taken and she and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Laura and Walker were returning to the hotel
lobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so do we,&rdquo; the other girls chorused, as
the party all came together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you go, but you return.&rdquo; Walker sounded
quite poetic as he said this. &ldquo;And then, remember,
you have no conception of the adventures the
hacienda holds in store for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; The girls looked suspiciously at
Walker, when Nan asked this question.</p>

<p>His answer was a mysterious look.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE HACIENDA</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;That must be it over there,&rdquo; Walker Jamieson
pointed to a low rambling building nestled
among the hills, as the car swung around a curve
in the road.</p>

<p>The party had, despite sundry irritating delays,
left Mexico City in the middle of the forenoon,
and now, as evening approached they did sight
the hacienda, their destination and proposed home
for the summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About time,&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie said curtly.
&ldquo;Hundred miles from Mexico City. Humph!
That&rsquo;s what they told me in Memphis. Hundred
miles maybe, as the crow flies, but on this treacherous
piece of bandit-infested highway it&rsquo;s at least
two hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked about him, as he finished, as though
he was daring someone to gainsay him. No one
accepted the dare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he surveyed the silent
group. &ldquo;All worn out?&rdquo; Again, there was no
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you,&rdquo; he looked directly at Nan now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
&ldquo;are you backing down on your old cousin? Don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
even get anyone to fight with me any more.&rdquo; He
really sounded pathetic.</p>

<p>At this, the whole group broke down in
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Adair laughed too now, but
his face bore a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, dad.&rdquo; Alice wiped the tears from
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothing to me, child.&rdquo; Adair brandished
his cane as though he was going to take
Alice over his knee and spank her. &ldquo;What were
you trying to do,&rdquo; he jumped to the correct conclusion
immediately, &ldquo;give me the silent treatment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice nodded her head half guiltily, half roguishly.
The idea had been hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother tried that years ago,&rdquo; Adair
reminisced. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t work then, and it&rsquo;s not
working now. It&rsquo;s better to give me an opportunity
to explode,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Volcanoes have to
erupt or something terrible happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said, sir.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson
agreed with the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say, to sit right there and say,&rdquo;
Adair exploded &ldquo;that you had the gall to liken
me to a volcano?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Walker nodded his head in agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You-you-you, why, I like you!&rdquo; Adair thrust
out his hand and shook that of the young reporter.
&ldquo;You say what you think no matter how dire the
consequences. Maybe you&rsquo;re not such a bad reporter
after all.&rdquo; He said this as though he was
making a great concession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. No, sir.&rdquo; Walker hardly knew what
to say in the face of all this unexpectedness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, come on here,&rdquo; Adair turned around
and addressed this to the driver. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t this old
jallopie do more than 15 miles an hour even when
it sees its berth in the distance.&rdquo; He too, pointed
to the white buildings that stood out from the
green foliage around them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bad looking place, from here.&rdquo; He went
on contentedly. &ldquo;Supposed to be one of the finest
in the district, but you never can tell about such
comparisons. Been fooled too many times to believe
much of what I hear now. Take everything
with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear that, girl?&rdquo; He turned to Nan. &ldquo;Best
always not to believe what you hear. Discount at
least fifty percent and then draw your own conclusions.
That right, Jamieson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker nodded his head in complete agreement.
It was one of the first lessons he had learned
as a cub reporter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as they talked, the car climbed a steep
hill. At the top, they turned to the right and came
upon the hacienda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How perfectly lovely!&rdquo; Alice&rsquo;s face was all
aglow as she caught her first real glimpse of the
place. The buildings were in Spanish style of a
stucco material of a color bordering on the pink.
There were iron balconies, large windows, and a
courtyard or patio complete with palms, a fountain,
and seats.</p>

<p>The girls had thought that there could be
nothing in the world so pretty as the patio in their
hotel in Mexico City, but here already was one
that surpassed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie was as pleased
as the others at his first sight of the place, but
more cautious than they and more reluctant to let
his real feelings be known, he let his &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
be his only comment as he descended from the
car and walked with the others through the archway
into the courtyard.</p>

<p>There crowds of natives awaited the arrival of
the new master, and the overseer of the place
hurried forth to greet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eet ees a pleasure, señor,&rdquo; he said as he
took Adair&rsquo;s hand and bowed deeply. The rest in
the party smiled and hung back at this bit of
Mexican courtesy. Walker grinned broadly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Señorita, are next,&rdquo; he whispered in
Alice&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Are you prepared to have your hand
kissed by a servant who would consider it an honor
to die in your service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; Alice murmured, and then smiled
as the overseer did come forward, take her hand
and bow deeply. &ldquo;Buenos días, señorita,&rdquo; he
greeted her. &ldquo;May your stay here be as pleasant
to you as your honoring us with your presence has
been to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; Adair was always impatient
with the elaborate courtesies of the south, impatient
probably because he never felt at ease
with them. &ldquo;I always suspect,&rdquo; Alice laughed once
when she and Walker were talking about Adair&rsquo;s
abruptness, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s more than a little afraid
that some day some one of these strangers will
break down and kiss him on the cheek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he would do?&rdquo; Walker paused
in speculation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might try it yourself, sometime, and find
out,&rdquo; Alice retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to have me ousted bag and baggage
from your presence, fair lady?&rdquo; Walker
questioned, but Alice never had a chance to answer,
for just at that moment her father came
upon the two and demanded all their attention.</p>

<p>Alice smiled over this in recollection now as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
they went through the door of the main building
and into a spacious entrance hall with its big winding
stairway, its high-beamed ceiling, and its pretty
tiled floor. Walker caught the smile and guessed
at its origin, but he said nothing as they were all
escorted up the broad steps to their quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours, all ours?&rdquo; Bess questioned when the
Lakeview Hall girls were conducted to a suite of
five rooms overlooking on one side the patio and
the other, a river, broad fields, and mountains in
the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Si, si, Señoritas,&rdquo; the smiling Mexican maid,
Soledad, who was to be theirs during their stay,
hadn&rsquo;t understood the question, but &ldquo;Si, si,&rdquo;
seemed the proper answer. Now she bustled about
trying to help them until her curiosity as to what
was going on downstairs got the better of her
and on some slight pretext she left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just think of it!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed when she
had disappeared. &ldquo;A whole suite of rooms of our
own, a maid, and everything, oh, everything we
can wish for. It&rsquo;s a magic country and Adair MacKenzie
is the presiding genie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he is in one way,&rdquo; Laura admitted
dryly. &ldquo;When he waves his wand things happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he goes up in smoke,&rdquo; Nan added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Laura laughed, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no one
that can do it more expertly.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Alone now, the girls went from one to another
of their rooms enjoying everything. Even Grace,
accustomed as she was to luxury, was greatly impressed.
She had never been in a house like this
before.</p>

<p>The rooms were big and spacious with heavy
oaken furniture, thick rugs, tapestries, and beds
so high that it was necessary to climb up a little
ladder in order to get to them. Each room had
big double windows opening out onto the patio.</p>

<p>Bess stood out on hers and looked down on the
courtyard below where maids were already busy
setting a table under a tree centuries old. &ldquo;Do
they ever serenade people here,&rdquo; she directed her
question toward those inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear that they do, sometimes,&rdquo; Nan called
back. &ldquo;But you have to wait for a clear night, with
a sky that&rsquo;s blue as blue can be, a moon big and
silver, shining low over these pretty buildings,
and stars that are bigger and closer to earth than
any you have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan Sherwood,&rdquo; Bess came into the
room now. &ldquo;Where did you learn all these
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Nan shrugged her shoulders, &ldquo;this atmosphere
gets into your blood and you just can&rsquo;t
help yourself. There is only one regret that I
have.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo; Bess couldn&rsquo;t imagine anyone having
any regrets at this time. The world seemed
just perfect to her now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Rhoda isn&rsquo;t here with us,&rdquo; Nan replied
promptly. She had been thinking of Rhoda a great
deal in the past few days that had been such fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Grace agreed with Nan softly. &ldquo;I
have been thinking of her too. We should be hearing
from her now in a few days because in those
last letters that we sent we told her to direct all
future mail to this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how you get your mail here,&rdquo; Laura
said. &ldquo;Do you suppose a Mexican caballero comes
dashing up on a donkey, sweeps his hat in a wide
arc toward the ground, and then deposits the bills
and things as though they were special messages
from the king of Spain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura, don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Bess was taking
her romance seriously and didn&rsquo;t want it to be
spoiled with laughter. &ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; she
turned to Nan now, &ldquo;that all those people that we
saw down there in the courtyard live on this
estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably those and many more,&rdquo; Nan assented,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the tour of the
estate that&rsquo;s been promised before we know for
sure. And there are a million other things, at least
that I want to know about.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Laura agreed, and the rest chimed
in, for this Mexican hacienda was something that
captured the imagination of all of them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>STUBBORN FOOLS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, you should see yourself now,&rdquo; Nan
laughed the next morning. It was early and the
girls were all mounted on mules as they passed
through the archway of the patio and out into the
gardens with their huge palms and brilliant flowers
and birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel like a fool myself,&rdquo; Adair grumbled as
he tried to adjust his position on the beast he was
riding. And truly, he was a ridiculous figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dad,&rdquo; Alice pretended that she was
trying to mollify him, &ldquo;you just weren&rsquo;t made to
ride a mule. Nor were you,&rdquo; she looked at
Walker Jamieson&rsquo;s long dangling legs as she
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor you either,&rdquo; Walker retorted laughing.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too little. Hey, you,&rdquo; he broke off his
conversation with Alice quickly and called to Nan,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Nan asked innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know. Don&rsquo;t look so innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Sherwood!&rdquo; Bess guessed at what
Walker was driving at. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking pictures
of us in <em>these</em> outfits are you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She not only is, but she has,&rdquo; Walker answered
before Nan could say anything. &ldquo;I saw her sliding
that little camera back into its case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, please,&rdquo; Alice joined in the protest,
&ldquo;have mercy on us and think how our children and
grandchildren will laugh if they ever see pictures
of us riding mule-back. We&rsquo;re all perfect sights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nan had already taken the pictures, so the
protests came too late. Now it was Adair MacKenzie
who diverted their attention. &ldquo;Get along
there. Get a move on, you slow poke.&rdquo; Adair was
kicking the sides of his mule with real force. But
the mule was accustomed to such treatment and
he only raised his ears lazily, turned his head
slowly and looked at his rider sleepily. Then he
stopped, dead in his tracks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get along there, get along, I say,&rdquo; Adair
kicked the mule again. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand
plain English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understands only Spanish, I guess, Mr. MacKenzie,&rdquo;
Walker said. &ldquo;Try that on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t understand English, the best language
in the world, he can&rsquo;t understand anything,&rdquo;
Adair was as stubborn as the mule he was
on, but for once all his railing, all his sputtering,
all the ordering that he could do, didn&rsquo;t accomplish
a thing. The mule just wouldn&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you,&rdquo; Adair called ahead to their guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
who had philosophically shrugged his shoulders
at the outburst of the new master, and sat now,
on his mule on the trail above waiting for the
party to move on. At the call, he ambled back to
see what was wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, you,&rdquo; Adair was impatient with everyone
and everything now. &ldquo;Get a hustle on. It&rsquo;s today
we want to see this blasted estate, today. Not
mañana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guide understood one word, &lsquo;mañana.&rsquo; His
face broke into a broad grin. &ldquo;Si, si, señor. Si,
Señoritas.&rdquo; He was more than glad that these
strangers could speak his language. Now, he broke
out into a voluble explanation, all in Spanish of
course, as to how to treat a mule.</p>

<p>Walker stood off laughing heartily at the whole
situation. Adair MacKenzie did not understand
one single word of what was being said to him,
but it was coming forth so fast that he could
neither interrupt nor stop the flow. For once in his
life he looked utterly helpless.</p>

<p>Alice was as amused as Walker. &ldquo;Poor dear,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;to think that he should come all of this
way to be baffled by a mule and a man whose
philosophy says &lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, we will do it
&lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adair saw their smiles. It was more than he
could stand, more than any man could stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Awkwardly, he dismounted from his beast, walked
around in front and shook his ever present cane
at him. The beast did nothing but blink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, wh-wh-why, you good-for-nothing,
senseless, no-count, beast you,&rdquo; he burst forth in
a torrent, &ldquo;if you think you can stop me, you&rsquo;re
mistaken. You&rsquo;ll go up there if I have to carry
you and you&rsquo;ll not take a picture of that either,&rdquo;
Adair turned to Nan with this last. It was somehow
much more satisfying to explode to Nan than
to either the beast or the Mexican.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, cousin,&rdquo; Nan answered as seriously as she
could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be meek either.&rdquo; He brandished
his cane again. &ldquo;Never get anyplace like that.&rdquo;
There was no satisfying the man now. Neither
agreement nor disagreement could placate him.
Nan kept still.</p>

<p>It was Alice finally, who smoothed his ruffled
feelings and got him back on the mule. &ldquo;Now,
daddy,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll just sit quietly
and wait, the mule will go, but you can&rsquo;t beat him
into action the way you do me.&rdquo; Saying this she
laughed up at him. He stooped over and kissed
her.</p>

<p>It was nice to see this father and daughter
together. They seemed to understand one another
perfectly. Adair, explode as he might, could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
frighten Alice. She knew how soft-hearted and
kind he was underneath all his crust. She had
known from babyhood that he wouldn&rsquo;t intentionally,
for all his angry outbursts, hurt anyone.</p>

<p>Now, having smoothed his ruffled feelings
some, she let Walker assist her back on her mule.
The party moved slowly along the narrow stony
trail while huge limbs of great palm trees waved
slightly above them.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of a high hill on the estate
they looked out over the countryside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Laura, ever curious, indicated
a point in the distance, something that showed
black against the sky and that clearly had been
built by man.</p>

<p>Walker drew forth his field glasses and directed
his glance toward the object. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; he
rendered his verdict after some thought, &ldquo;but think
it might be a pyramid. There are several in the
district you know. Perhaps the most famous of
them all is the one that a hunter down from New
York discovered three or four years ago. It&rsquo;s
rather inaccessible, but such an old one that some
old codger in the East with a lot of money on his
hands donated a considerable sum to have it
opened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they find?&rdquo; Nan asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots of dried up bones.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That all?&rdquo; Nan sounded disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; Walker admitted and then
stopped. He enjoyed teasing these youngsters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did they find then,&rdquo; Nan persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some jewels. Some gold. Some exceptionally
fine pottery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; Nan saw that he was still holding
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some poison spiders that killed three members
of the excavation party. Now you satisfied?&rdquo;
Walker grinned down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Nan agreed. &ldquo;But I still want to
visit a pyramid sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Visit those in Egypt,&rdquo; Walker advised.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more impressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You been there?&rdquo; Nan questioned. The path
was wide enough so that they could ride now with
their mules side by side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, years ago, with my father,&rdquo; Walker answered.
&ldquo;He had a bad case of the wanderlust,
so whenever he could scrape a few dollars together,
off he would go to some outlandish place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking your mother with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sometimes. She went up into Alaska when
he went to pan gold from the streams. She went
down into South America when he went as an
engineer on a big industrial project. And she went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
when he set out for Russia after the revolution,
but after that she gave up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be like your father,&rdquo; Nan
commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little,&rdquo; Walker admitted. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t
quite got the wanderlust as much as he has. He
could go into raptures over anything that was far
away from him. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of him a lot
today, riding over this estate. He spent some time
down here in Mexico, and never grew tired of
extolling the country. This was after my mother
died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though we are not entering the country at all
that he was fondest of, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of his
descriptions of it, especially after seeing that
pyramid in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was down in Oaxaca and was called, I believe,
Tehuantepec. It took days to get there by
horseback, according to his account, and the route
was through tropical jungles more dense than any
others in the world. You see my father never saw
mediocre things,&rdquo; he explained by the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The City itself lay on a river by the same
name in a gorgeous tropical setting surrounded
by orchards and many gardens, all shaded by
flowering trees and palms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The population was largely Indian, a tribe
that had its own language and preserved its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
traditions, but it seems that above all this particular
tribe was known for its beautiful women, more
independent, more lovely, and more beautifully
dressed than any of the women in other tribes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He described them as being tall, well-built,
and industrious. Their dresses consisted of long
full skirts made of bright colors with a deep white
flounce at the bottom, that swept the ground
and covered their bare feet. The blouse was short
and square-necked and for adornment they wore
much jewelry, earrings and long heavy chains hung
with ten and twenty American gold pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had a graceful carriage, walking straight
and firmly with an ease that only those women
who have been trained to carry things on their
head have. These people, he said, carry their
flowers, fruit, and foods to the market in painted
gourd bowls perched firmly on the crowns of their
heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, those people were perfect, more perfect
my father said than any he had ever come
across. But then, my father,&rdquo; Walker admitted
boyishly, &ldquo;always did tell a grand tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you became a newspaper man,&rdquo;
Nan concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; Walker admitted. &ldquo;You
know this taste for queer places and queer things
is often bred right in your bones.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you two talking about back
there?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie suddenly became conscious
of the fact that two in his party were paying
no attention whatsoever to him and his troubles
with his mule. Had he had a horse, he would
liked to have galloped back beside them, but with
a mule there was no galloping. As it was he turned
the mule&rsquo;s head sharply.</p>

<p>It was just too much. The mule was tired of his
burden anyway, so before anyone realized at all
what was happening, Adair was deposited firmly
on the ground and the mule, with more intelligence
perhaps than he had been given credit for,
was gazing at him soberly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>IN A PATIO</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt? Daddy, are you hurt?&rdquo; Alice
cried, but even as she did, tears of laughter were
rolling down her cheeks. She had never in her life
seen her father in such a ridiculous position, which
was saying something, for Adair MacKenzie had
a knack of getting himself in more absurd situations
than anyone else in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop your blubbering.&rdquo; Adair was thoroughly
irritated this time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll conquer you yet.&rdquo; He
scolded the mule. &ldquo;Think you can vanquish
Adair MacKenzie, do you? I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; But
to all of this scolding that fell dully on the tropical
verdure about them, that sounded harsh and
out of place in the soft greenness of the scene, the
mule never blinked an eyelash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy, are you hurt?&rdquo; Alice repeated her
question as she took hold of one arm while
Walker Jamieson took the other.</p>

<p>But their offers of assistance went unappreciated.
Adair MacKenzie merely shook off their
hands, used his own to push himself up, and then
stood, brushing himself off while he continued his
tirade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re going home, and you&rsquo;re going to
stay there.&rdquo; Adair spluttered off into the kind of
scolding that he might have given an erring child.
With this, he about faced and walked, leading the
mule beside him the three miles back to the
hacienda.</p>

<p>It was a quiet party, but one full of suppressed
mirth, that wound its way back over the path.
The Lakeview Hall girls could scarcely contain
themselves until they got in their apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just perfect.&rdquo; Laura laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the way he looked, and the way
the donkey looked?&rdquo; Amelia asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They just stared at one another until I thought
that cousin Adair would beat the beast with his
cane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of that, too,&rdquo; Bess said. &ldquo;But I
guess he&rsquo;s too kind-hearted to do anything like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was right. Adair MacKenzie had never in
his life made any attempt to hurt a dumb animal
in any way until that morning when he had dug
his heels in irritation into the mule&rsquo;s side. At
home, he always had animals about him, a dog
that was now well along in years, a stable full of
horses, and yes, a mule that he once bought on the
street when he saw its master trying to beat it
into moving along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The crust of that mule,&rdquo; Laura said slangily.
&ldquo;Did it ever do my heart good to see its stubbornness
matched against Mr. MacKenzie&rsquo;s! I wonder
what kind of a character sketch he would make of
it, if he had the chance, that is, I mean, if the
mule could understand him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably, &lsquo;stubborn fool&rsquo; and let it go at
that,&rdquo; Nan answered. &ldquo;Anyway his troubles with
that mule will never be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;stubborn as a mule&rsquo;, will always mean
something to us now,&rdquo; Nan added. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ve
got to get ready and get downstairs. Dinner&rsquo;s
going to be ready very shortly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the girls changed their clothes, washed,
combed and presented themselves downstairs all
clean and neat.</p>

<p>There was no one around. They walked through
the great hall and out into the patio. Still they
found no one except the servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw so much help in all my life,&rdquo;
Grace remarked. &ldquo;Why, just millions of people
work here. I haven&rsquo;t seen the same person twice
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear Walker Jamieson say that
labor&rsquo;s cheap in this country?&rdquo; Nan explained.
&ldquo;Everyone has one or two or three servants. But
I wonder where cousin Adair and everyone is
now.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>She hadn&rsquo;t long to wait, for just as she spoke
they heard loud voices from the direction of the
kitchen at the back, and shortly Adair, Alice and
Walker appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There that&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; Adair slapped his hands
together as though he had just disposed of a
mighty problem. &ldquo;Trouble, trouble all the while,&rdquo;
he looked at the girls as he spoke. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t one
thing, it&rsquo;s another. One moment it&rsquo;s a mule and
the next it&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo; He looked utterly worn
out, and Nan felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, daddy, don&rsquo;t take Mrs. O&rsquo;Malley too
seriously,&rdquo; Alice tried to ease his worry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too seriously! Well, I like that,&rdquo; Adair exclaimed.
&ldquo;When the best housekeeper in all Christendom
threatens to walk out on you, tell me now,
what are you supposed to do? Say, all right, go
ahead? Just what would you do, now?&rdquo; He looked
at Alice.</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t give her a chance to answer,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;d walk out on you before you did
anything. You can&rsquo;t hesitate in serious matters
like this. You have to act. But never mind,&rdquo; he
turned to his guests, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to worry. I
have acted. Mrs. O&rsquo;Malley has promised to stay.
The Chinese cook has promised to stay. Everyone&rsquo;s
staying. There&rsquo;ll be no deserting the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
on this trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, daddy,&rdquo; Alice complimented him.
&ldquo;And now when do we have dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner? Where&rsquo;s dinner?&rdquo; Adair was off
again. He picked up a bell and rang it forcefully.
Everyone, except the famous Mrs. O&rsquo;Malley and
the Chinese cook came running. People came out
of doors, in through the arches of the patio, and
stuck their heads out from windows. Everyone
thought that there was something radically wrong.
When they saw that it was just the American
again, they disappeared as quickly as they came.</p>

<p>The old women shook their heads. Would he
never learn, they wondered, that there was no
necessity to rush anything, that if you let things
just go their own quiet, placid way, they would
eventually work themselves out. They couldn&rsquo;t
understand this man who had come to them as
their master. Already, thanks to the guide of the
morning, legends about him and his wrath were
spreading around the place. The wireless that
civilization knows is fast, but the grapevine among
the Mexican Indians was even more effective.</p>

<p>When he saw the commotion he had caused,
Adair MacKenzie sat down, and shortly dinner
appeared, as it would have appeared even though
he had done nothing.</p>

<p>The dinner was good and the cool fruit juices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that followed it were good. And everyone sat, as
long as the warmth of the day permitted, in the
patio under the tropical sky and talked some, sat
silent more, for it was all very peaceful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not going to work on that smuggling
story after all?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie asked Walker
just before they all got up to go in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Walker answered
carefully. &ldquo;Feel the need of a little rest now and
I like this place and I like the people and it&rsquo;s hard
to tear myself away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thank you, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Adair took his
daughter&rsquo;s hand in his. He felt vaguely that there
was something more serious in all of this than
appeared on the surface, but just now he was too
tired to question. He squeezed Alice&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>STOLEN!</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Nan, it&rsquo;s a letter from Rhoda,&rdquo; Bess repeated
the information twice before she got any response
at all, and then it was only a grunt. It was the
morning after the famous mule-back excursion,
and Nan was in her room alone until Bess&rsquo;s
entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever are you doing?&rdquo; Bess asked when
she saw that Nan, strangely enough, didn&rsquo;t seem
to be interested in her bit of information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, I can&rsquo;t find it anyplace,&rdquo; Nan looked
as though the world had come to an end. She had
all that she could do to keep from crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my ring. You know the one I mean, the
one old Mr. Blake gave me in Scotland last summer.
He said it was a family heirloom and that I
should keep it as long as I lived and then see that
it was passed on down to my children. Now, it&rsquo;s
gone and I&rsquo;m sure I left it in this room when we
went away yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Nan?&rdquo; Bess looked worried too,
now. The ring was a lovely thing with the bluest
of blue sapphires in an old-fashioned gold setting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Bess had coveted it herself, and often wanted to
wear it. But she respected Nan&rsquo;s sentiment about
the bit of jewelry enough to have not even asked
to try it on.</p>

<p>Now it was gone!</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you wear it last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, I had it on yesterday morning before we
went on that trip by muleback and I took it off
because I was afraid I would lose it. I left it in
this box I&rsquo;m sure, and it isn&rsquo;t here now. I&rsquo;ve looked
through it a dozen times.&rdquo; As she finished, she
proffered the box to Bess, who took it, opened it
up, and carefully looked through the trinkets
contained therein. The ring wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you told anybody, yet?&rdquo; Bess questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but if it doesn&rsquo;t come to light pretty soon,
I&rsquo;m going to tell cousin Adair. I&rsquo;m almost afraid
to do that, because he values the ring almost as
much as I. He saw it once, he said, when he was
in Scotland, and he was proud to think that it
came to me. Now I&rsquo;ve lost it, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll
think that I&rsquo;ve been very careless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what he thinks,&rdquo; Bess said
firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell him right away. If someone
has stolen it, he&rsquo;s the only one that can find
the culprit. Come on, let&rsquo;s go downstairs now. Or
do you want me to hunt first?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do that.&rdquo; Nan did dread telling Adair
MacKenzie of her loss.</p>

<p>Bess looked thoroughly, but nowhere could she
find the ring.</p>

<p>So together, the two girls went down the stairs,
Bess this time in the role of comforter.</p>

<p>They found Adair out in the gardens talking
as best he could with an old gardener who knew
at least a few words of English. Adair looked up
at their entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you like flowers, too,&rdquo; he greeted them.
Nan nodded her head, and then couldn&rsquo;t say anything
for a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Nancy child,&rdquo; Adair
was all sympathy as he noted the worried look on
the girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Nothing serious, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; Nan answered. &ldquo;You know
my ring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sapphire ring that you brought home
from Scotland?&rdquo; Adair said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nan nodded her head to indicate that
he was right. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, missing?&rdquo; Adair asked.
&ldquo;Have you lost it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was in my room, and it&rsquo;s gone now.&rdquo;
Nan said this very positively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone, gone where?&rdquo; Adair flared up as usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nan was having
a difficult time being patient. &ldquo;I wish I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s stolen.&rdquo; Adair now had the
girls by the arm and was taking them back to the
hacienda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to say that,&rdquo; Nan hedged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what happened, speak up.&rdquo; Adair
wanted to get to the bottom of this right away
and although he was very fond of Nan he wasn&rsquo;t
going to spare her or her feelings any now. The
ring, he felt, was a personal loss to him too and
as he went into the house, he was determined to
find it.</p>

<p>First he quizzed all the girls to find out, if by
chance, they knew of anything that would indicate
that Nan was mistaken. They didn&rsquo;t. No one
had seen her wearing it after the time at which
she said she had put it away.</p>

<p>Then he quizzed all of the upstairs&rsquo; servants.
This was done with Walker&rsquo;s help, since he was
the only one in the crowd that knew any Spanish
at all. Again, there was no light cast on the
mystery.</p>

<p>He called in all the rest of the house servants,
with no results. Then he blustered and fumed and
threatened, but this to no avail.</p>

<p>Finally, with one last grand threat that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
would find out who the culprit was in spite of
everybody, he sent everyone from the room.</p>

<p>The girls went up to their quarters together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, who do you suppose could have done
anything like that?&rdquo; Bess wondered as they all sat
around listlessly and hopelessly, for there was
nothing that they could do. &ldquo;Do you suspect anyone,
Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one in this whole wide world.&rdquo; Nan answered
wholeheartedly. &ldquo;The servants since we
have been here have all been just as nice as they
could be. I don&rsquo;t think there is a one of them that
would stoop to anything like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; soft-spoken Grace
agreed, &ldquo;but then someone has taken it. We&rsquo;re
sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As sure as we are of anything,&rdquo; Nan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it very valuable, Nan?&rdquo; Amelia asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Nan answered. &ldquo;I
think, however, that the value is mostly sentimental.
It was originally given to one of the Blakes
as a reward by the king. It was supposed then to
have the power to bring the king&rsquo;s soldiers to the
help of the person wearing it, in whatever trouble
he might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a story that once, someone who
owned it committed treason and was about to be
beheaded when he brought forth the ring. It saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
him, even then, and instead of killing him they
banished him to another country for ten years.
Ordinarily, it would have been death or a life
banishment, but the ring&rsquo;s power was mighty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe then,&rdquo; Laura suggested, &ldquo;if you or
your cousin will offer a reward, the ring will turn
up. The person that stole it probably thought that
it was valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; Nan answered, &ldquo;but cousin
Adair says &lsquo;no,&rsquo; that he will get the ring back
without any such monkey business. So I guess we&rsquo;ll
just have to leave it up to him.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>BESS HAS SUSPICIONS</small></h2>


<p>They did leave it up to Adair MacKenzie, and
for several days nothing happened. The house was
like a morgue, for everyone suspected everyone
else and the servants were all under suspicion.</p>

<p>Finally, Nan couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer, and
decided to do a little investigating on her own. It
was Bess who put her on the track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust Chinamen,&rdquo; Bess had confided
and then felt foolish immediately afterward, for
if there was one thing that Nan resented above
all others, it was race prejudice in any form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Nan dismissed the
statement shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bess persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Harley,&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;if you
make that remark again, I&rsquo;ll never speak to you
as long as I live.&rdquo; Nan was cross and irritable
these days, because nothing seemed to be going
right and she felt that if she hadn&rsquo;t said anything
about the ring in the first place, everyone would
be enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Nan,&rdquo; Bess put her arm around her
friend. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it all the way you think. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
haven&rsquo;t liked the cook ever since that first day
when he had a fight with Mrs. O&rsquo;Malley and
she&rsquo;s such a dear too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Bess, you know how that happened,&rdquo;
Nan protested. &ldquo;Mrs. O&rsquo;Malley went into the kitchen
that he had run for some twenty years and
tried to tell him what to do. He just wouldn&rsquo;t
stand for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even then, I don&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo; Bess persisted.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been horrid and mean to all of us ever
since we&rsquo;ve been here. I think he stole your ring,
and if you don&rsquo;t do something about it, I&rsquo;m going
to tell Mr. MacKenzie myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Bess,&rdquo; Nan was very serious now.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t keep quiet about what you have
just been saying to me, I&rsquo;m going to be very
angry. I don&rsquo;t want suspicions being cast on people
who haven&rsquo;t done anything, and I don&rsquo;t think he
has, honestly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess paused and thought before she said anything
further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Bess,&rdquo; Nan said more softly now, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
resent the way I&rsquo;ve talked to you these days. I
feel very troubled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess felt badly too now. It wasn&rsquo;t very often
that Nan let her temper get away with her, and
since she had, Bess thought, she must be more
troubled than any of us realize. So the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was dropped between the two friends.</p>

<p>But Bess&rsquo;s remarks had done their work. When
Nan was alone, the thought of what Bess had
said, came back to her again and again. She dismissed
it impatiently at first, but then little things
about the cook began to come to her attention
constantly.</p>

<p>Finally she determined to do something about
it all and so, one day when she was alone, she
went back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>She was just about to open the door and go
through when she heard loud voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s not enough,&rdquo; one, an American
voice was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alle samee, it&rsquo;s all I can get.&rdquo; The voice of
the cook came to her in reply.</p>

<p>Nan stopped, startled. This, why, this verified
Bess&rsquo;s suspicions. Nan stood back and listened
further, but heard nothing. She had come in on
the end of the argument. Shortly, she heard a
door slam on the other side of the kitchen, and
then there were no more sounds at all.</p>

<p>She waited for some time, and then cautiously
opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>Over in one corner, the cook, alone, was busy
preparing the evening meal. He looked up as the
girl entered, and was on the point of reprimanding
her for invading his quarters when he stopped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
recognizing her. He waited then, resentfully, for
her to speak.</p>

<p>Nan was equally wary however, so there was
a moment of embarrassed silence, before either
said anything. Then, as they stood waiting, a call
outside distracted their attention.</p>

<p>The cook answered it, and when he returned,
they both felt more at ease. He brought her a
stool to sit on and offered her some of his choice
cookies, so before long they were talking to one
another. They talked about little things, and Nan
went away without mentioning the ring or the
conversation she had heard at all.</p>

<p>But she went back the next day. Following this
procedure it wasn&rsquo;t long before the cook poured
out his whole sorry tale.</p>

<p>Nan later, when she got Walker Jamieson
alone, told it and swore him to secrecy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he took the ring,&rdquo; Walker concluded,
when the story had all been told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said so,&rdquo; Nan was being very careful
that the facts were all understood as they
were, not as other people might imagine them
to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not in so many words,&rdquo; Walker agreed,
&ldquo;but then, he did. You and I know that, and it&rsquo;s
not necessary to tell anyone at all anything about
this yet. It&rsquo;s a bigger story than you realize,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
ended, &ldquo;and it has many, many more angles than
this particular one. Let me work on it awhile
without any interference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan agreed to this, and so the two conspirators
parted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>SERENADERS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on downstairs?&rdquo; Laura came
into Nan&rsquo;s room quietly. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s none of
my business,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but everything seems
to be in an uproar. Your cousin is ranting around
as I&rsquo;ve never seen him rant before, and Walker
Jamieson is there and he looks as though everything
is wrong with the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nan looked up from
the diary she was writing, a diary in which she
kept a day by day account of her trip. But she
looked worried. Had Walker, after all, told the
story that they had promised to keep a secret and
was her cousin insisting on getting to the bottom
of everything right away?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were they talking about?&rdquo; she asked
Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;When I
came through the room, they stopped, and seemed
to be waiting until I got out, before continuing.
I got the point and hurried. I was only after a
magazine that I had left in the room, anyway.
But even for the short time I was in there, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
air seemed so heavy with emotion that you could
cut it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t hear anything?&rdquo; Nan repeated
the thought of her former question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo; Laura insisted. &ldquo;Why, what did
you expect me to hear?&rdquo; She looked at her friend
intently. As Bess often did in similar circumstances,
Laura now felt that Nan knew much
more about what was going on downstairs than
she wanted to reveal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Nan managed to say this airily,
as though she truly had had nothing in view when
she asked the question. So saying, she screwed the
top on her fountain pen, put her diary away, and
stamped a letter she had just written home. With
these little things done, she turned again to Laura,
&ldquo;Do you know that Grace&rsquo;s brother and his
friends are expected here at the hacienda tomorrow?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they? Tomorrow?&rdquo; Laura had been out
in the courtyard watching some Mexican youngsters
at play when Grace had told Nan. Now, the
information was a surprise to her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s been
planned? How many will there be? How long
will they stay?&rdquo; The questions rolled off her
tongue one after the other, until Nan stopped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one at a time, please.
We&rsquo;ve not planned anything definite yet and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t know how many nor how long, but we&rsquo;re
hoping that they can stay at least a week. Isn&rsquo;t it
all going to be fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Laura was almost as excited as Nan.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be grand to have them all here.
Now, let&rsquo;s go and get the other girls and plan
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before they could get out of the room, the
others came bursting in. &ldquo;Oh, do you know,&rdquo; Bess
got the words out first, &ldquo;Walter and his friends
probably will arrive tonight.&rdquo; Amelia and Grace
nodded their heads in unison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Nan asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a telegram.&rdquo; Grace waved it in the air.
&ldquo;It says,&rdquo; she read, &ldquo;&lsquo;Arriving tonight. Six of us.
Anxious to see you. Walter.&rsquo; I wonder when
they&rsquo;ll get here.&rdquo; Saying this, she went over to the
windows and looked down into the courtyard as
though she expected them at once. Then she
turned toward the others again, &ldquo;How good it&rsquo;s
going to be!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a little
lonesome for someone from home ever since
Rhoda&rsquo;s mother became so ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you, Gracie?&rdquo; Nan put her arm affectionately
around the more timid girl&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;I guess we all have been. It will be good to see
Walter because he has seen all our parents since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
we left. Now let&rsquo;s go downstairs and tell cousin
Adair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the girls lingered a little while longer, talking
and planning. &ldquo;It must have been fate that
kept us there,&rdquo; Laura laughed afterwards, for
one of the very nicest things of all their trip happened
just before they departed.</p>

<p>It was Nan who heard it first, that faint far-away
sound of the strumming of a guitar. &ldquo;Sh!
Quiet!&rdquo; she broke in on the hubbub in the room.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that I hear?&rdquo; They all listened for a
second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo; Laura waved the question
aside, &ldquo;and do you think we can get Mr. MacKenzie
to go with us again on a mule ride over
the estate?&rdquo; she went on with the planning of
entertainment for the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too something,&rdquo; Nan insisted, for she
heard again the sound of music. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, you&rsquo;re hearing things,&rdquo; Laura perhaps
was more impatient than any of the others,
for she was intrigued with the idea of asking
Adair to get on a mule again, and she wanted to
talk about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo; Bess heard the strains now.
&ldquo;I hear something too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;oh, look!&rdquo; Nan was at a balcony
window beckoning the others eagerly. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
clustered round her, and there in the moonlit
courtyard below them Walter and his friends
were serenading the girls. When they all appeared,
the music grew louder, stronger, and the
boys harmonized their voices as they sang for
the second time,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Soft o&rsquo;er the fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ling&rsquo;ring falls the southern moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far o&rsquo;er the mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breaks the day too soon!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In thy dark eyes&rsquo; splendor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the warm light loves to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary looks, yet tender,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Speak their fond fare-well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nita! Juanita!&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they swung into the chorus, the girls, laughing
but enjoying it all thoroughly, pulled flowers
that they had picked that day from the garden
from their dresses and threw them down. The
chorus ended, and the girls clapped. The boys
laughed up at them, and others in the courtyard
who had been attracted by the music called for
more.</p>

<p>It was all very gay and happy. The boys did
sing an encore, and then as Alice and Adair came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
out on the veranda they broke off, and Walter
went up the steps and introduced himself and his
friends. The girls came down and they all had a
merry evening together, talking over the million
and one things that had been happening.</p>

<p>It was not until the afternoon of the next day,
that Nan and Walter had a moment alone together.
Then she told him the story of her missing
ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the cook didn&rsquo;t actually tell you that he
took it?&rdquo; Walter asked at the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he implied it,&rdquo; Nan answered, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m as sure he did as I am certain that he is not
to be blamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter couldn&rsquo;t restrain the smile that came
at this. Nan always trusted people, always felt
that there was good in everyone. This was one of
the things that first attracted Walter to her.
Somehow, she, unlike many others her own age,
never found enjoyment in criticising others. She
seemed to understand their faults and to be able
to explain them sympathetically no matter what
they were. Now, in talking of the man whom she
felt sure had stolen her ring, she honestly believed
that, in doing so, he had been influenced by conditions
over which he had no control. She felt
sorry for him, and didn&rsquo;t want to do him any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
injury. This was one of the big reasons why she
had pledged Walker Jamieson to secrecy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what does Mr. MacKenzie think of all
of this?&rdquo; Walter asked just before Nan left him
to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t know anything about it at all,&rdquo;
Nan hastened to explain, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want you
to say a thing. This is all a secret until&mdash;until&mdash;until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until what?&rdquo; Walter looked at the young
girl curiously, as she stopped midway in her
sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until it&rsquo;s solved,&rdquo; Nan smiled at her friend,
and then refused to explain further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy Sherwood,&rdquo; Walter spoke seriously
now, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not careful, you&rsquo;re going to get
yourself all involved in a plot that might hurt
you. Come, be sensible for once. Either forget the
ring entirely, or tell your cousin all that you know
about it. Promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan shook her head. She couldn&rsquo;t tell Walter
that she and Walker had already made certain
promises about the ring and the Chinaman&rsquo;s part
in its disappearance. She couldn&rsquo;t tell him that the
reporter sensed a big story and asked her to protect
the details until he had arrived at a solution.
She couldn&rsquo;t tell him, but she wanted to.</p>

<p>Now it was Grace who saved what otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
might have been an embarrassing situation. She
came out into the corner of the patio where Nan
and Walter were standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;did you know that Walker
Jamieson left the hacienda early this afternoon
and that he took his bags with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left the hacienda!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;are you
sure, Grace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As sure as I am of anything,&rdquo; Grace replied,
&ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t believe me you can either wait
to see if he appears at dinner, or you can go in
right now and ask Bess.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>WALKER DEPARTS</small></h2>


<p>However, it was Bess who sought Nan out, and
that before Grace had barely had time to finish
divulging her bit of news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; Bess greeted Nan as
soon as she could find her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Nan retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that talk we had some time ago up in
your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What talk?&rdquo; Nan pretended to have
forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know as well as I,&rdquo; Bess responded impatiently.
&ldquo;I mean that talk about Walker and
Alice. It was nice, but it&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that Walker talked to your cousin
sometime yesterday, that your cousin was simply
furious, and that Walker Jamieson has left, never
to return!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, don&rsquo;t get romantic about it,&rdquo; Nan
said abruptly. &ldquo;Now get your breath and tell me
actually what you know.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Bess insisted. &ldquo;Walker wanted to
marry Alice and Adair MacKenzie said &lsquo;no!&rsquo;
Walker left without saying goodby to anyone and
nobody knows when he is going to return if at all.
Alice has gone to her room, and everybody in the
house is all broken up, except the old housekeeper.
All she does is shake her head and say &lsquo;You just
wait. This will all be all right in the end. Young
people are too hasty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine that!&rdquo; Bess ran on indignantly. &ldquo;She
says young people are too hasty, when all the
trouble here is caused by Mr. MacKenzie and he
certainly isn&rsquo;t young!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Harley, you be careful!&rdquo; Nan
warned her friend. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know for sure
whether what you are saying is true or not. You&rsquo;ll
have everybody in trouble if you don&rsquo;t watch out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Nan, I could just cry,&rdquo; Bess protested.
&ldquo;He is such a nice person and so is she. And now
it&rsquo;s all spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Bess,&rdquo; Nan spoke more softly now.
Then she looked over at Walter as though begging
him to leave them for a few moments which
he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; she spoke sternly to Bess
when he disappeared. &ldquo;If there is anything at all
in what you say, and I doubt it, there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in the world to be gained by crying and talking
and interfering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interfering!&rdquo; Bess was indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then talking about it,&rdquo; Nan corrected
herself. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything about it except
sit around and wait. I don&rsquo;t believe that Walker
has gone away for the reason you say he has at
all, and if he has, he&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he hasn&rsquo;t gone away for that reason,
why has he gone at all?&rdquo; Bess demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Nan answered lamely. Why
was it, she thought, that she was forever running
into the secret that she had promised Walker she
would keep. She had done the same thing ten
minutes ago with Walter. Now she was doing it
with her best friend. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to wait and
find out,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Bess,&rdquo; she made a decided effort to
change the subject, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in and get the camera.
I want to take some pictures of the boys. Anyway
we are neglecting them by staying out here like
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neglecting them!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
done nothing all day but sit around and loaf.
They&rsquo;re a lazy bunch, and we all had such high
hopes.&rdquo; She let her sentence die away tragically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she wrinkled up her nose at Nan, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
she spoke, &ldquo;are boys in general so dumb? Oh,
Walter&rsquo;s all right, but all the rest are just like
bumps on a log.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nan denied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember last night when they were all out there
below our balconies? You didn&rsquo;t think they were
bumps on a log then, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess shook her head and her eyes shone. &ldquo;No,
that was grand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But today, they just
don&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they think that we&rsquo;re neglecting
them?&rdquo; Nan suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let them,&rdquo; Bess flounced away from
Nan and into the house.</p>

<p>Nan looked bewilderedly after her. &ldquo;What can
be wrong with Bess,&rdquo; she asked herself and then
did go after her camera. If Bess didn&rsquo;t want any
pictures of the visitors, she did.</p>

<p>A few hours later, after an afternoon siesta
and a long cool refreshing drink of fruit juices
beneath the palms of the courtyard, everyone felt
better. Alice&rsquo;s eyes were red and swollen with
crying, but she made an appearance. Adair MacKenzie
was even more terse than usual, but he
was kinder too. And Bess who had but three hours
before found the boys so disagreeable now was
surrounded by them. She was telling them in low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
tones of the donkey episode of the day before.</p>

<p>It was all very cheerful and pleasant despite the
emptiness that was felt because of Walker&rsquo;s absence.
However, no one mentioned his name. In
fact, he might have remained away from the
hacienda, away from Alice, indefinitely, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for Adair himself, Adair and Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, girls, how do you like your new
home now?&rdquo; Adair MacKenzie was feeling somewhat
talkative after his long refreshing drink of
loganberry juice. &ldquo;A pretty nice place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
He looked about himself with a satisfied sort of
appreciation. Adair MacKenzie for all of his
Scotch blood and his leanings toward economy
really liked the good things of life. This southern
home pleased him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s grand, Cousin Adair,&rdquo; Nan answered for
them all. &ldquo;Perfectly grand. There&rsquo;s only one thing
that&rsquo;s lacking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re missing Rhoda. She was so excited
about the plans to come down here that she could
hardly contain herself, and now we won&rsquo;t see her
all summer. We won&rsquo;t see her until we get back
to school in the fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said you wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Adair asked
suddenly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions like that.
Just to show you how wrong you are&mdash;you&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
leaving tomorrow morning by plane to visit with
this Hammond girl over the week end, and then
if it&rsquo;s at all possible, she is to come back with you
to stay here for a week or two. Now, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>NAN&rsquo;S BIG ADVENTURE</small></h2>


<p>Nan couldn&rsquo;t answer for a moment, then unexpectedly,
even to herself, she threw her arms
around Adair MacKenzie&rsquo;s neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; he straightened his necktie and
adjusted the soft white collar of his shirt after her
hug. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand for this. What&rsquo;s the matter?
Aren&rsquo;t you pleased?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s face was flushed and her
eyes bright as she answered. &ldquo;There was never
in all this wide world a nicer cousin than you are
being to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a second,&rdquo; Adair was immensely pleased
at this outburst. &ldquo;What will these young men all
think of you? Want to make them jealous of an
old codger like me? Better watch out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looked at the boys sitting around the
ground and in the big comfortable chairs and
blushed furiously. She had completely forgotten,
at the announcement of her proposed journey that
anyone else was present beside the girls whom she
knew so well.</p>

<p>But her embarrassment couldn&rsquo;t last long in the
face of the excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Nan was going for Rhoda! Nan was going by
plane to get Rhoda and bring her back. Nan was
going to start the next morning and by Monday
she would be back, having flown half the length
of Mexico to the border and then from there to
Rose Ranch.</p>

<p>It was exciting to think of, but then a thousand,
a million times more exciting in reality, for all
sorts of unexpected things were to come about
as the result of that ride.</p>

<p>Now, Nan could scarcely contain herself as she
sat in the group and listened to the little everyday
things they were talking about. The only
thing that really penetrated her consciousness was
the fact that she was leaving and that when she
returned Walter and his friends would have left.</p>

<p>Adair brought this fact to life. In his free open,
hospitable style, he tried to induce the youngsters
to linger. He liked them, liked the excitement
they had caused, for in spite of Bess&rsquo;s complaint
to Nan that they were a dull lot, they kept things
moving from the moment they serenaded their
hostesses until they left.</p>

<p>Through the days there had been hikes, parties,
a visit into the interior by auto, and an excursion
to a small village where the Indians were celebrating
a native holiday. They had seen them
dressed in native dress, dancing native dances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
with all the abandon of a people freed from the
daily routine, and they had witnessed one of their
elaborate religious rites in which the ritual of the
church and the ritual of pagan ancestors who
had worshipped the Sun God were mingled with
one another to result in a queer worship that was
unlike anything any place else in the world.</p>

<p>Then they all went to a moving picture show
where Roberta Taylor, the pretty little American
actress whom everybody adored spoke in Spanish.
How queer that seemed! They had all seen the
film&mdash;it was an old one&mdash;in a theatre in Chicago,
but how different it seemed now with all the conversation
translated into Spanish. They giggled
when the heroine looked up at her tall American
hero and murmured &ldquo;Señor, Señor,&rdquo; and when he
greeted her with &ldquo;Buenos Días&rdquo; and other common
Spanish phrases. It was all very charming
and amusing and everyone had a grand time.</p>

<p>But now Nan was going to leave and the boys
were going to leave. The evening, in spite of the
excitement about Nan&rsquo;s proposed journey, turned
a little sad when they all gathered around Walter
and his guitar to sing as they had each night since
he arrived. The songs they sang were all sad little
songs.</p>

<p>By next morning all this was forgotten. The
girls were all thrilled over Rhoda&rsquo;s coming. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had telegraphed to tell her what was happening
and she had wired back that her mother was well
enough now so that she could carry out the plans
that Adair MacKenzie had made with such enjoyment,
for he did enjoy doing things for other
people. He liked being Santa Claus the year
round.</p>

<p>So, by ten o&rsquo;clock the next day a whole caravan
drew up to the airport and Walter, his friends,
Bess, Laura, Grace, Amelia, Adair and Alice saw
Nan off. How exciting it was, getting the ticket,
standing by while the plane&rsquo;s motors were warmed
up, and then, when the passengers started to get
in, taking pictures of the plane, of the people
around it, and of the crew.</p>

<p>Finally, she was off and Nan was soaring over
the heads of all her friends. She looked out the
window and waved a big white handkerchief, but
already she seemed part of the clouds and those
below, waving too, couldn&rsquo;t see her.</p>

<p>How much fun it was climbing, climbing, climbing.
Nan wasn&rsquo;t worried at all. She looked out.
Around her were clouds and beneath her the
mountains of Mexico were stretched out. She was
higher than the mountains! Her spirits soared
with the thought and she looked around at her
fellow passengers, two men who were in earnest
conversation, a woman with a small child beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
her, and another man who seemed to be alone.</p>

<p>None of them looked particularly interesting
and Nan returned to her watching of the landscape,
so when, after they had traveled for some
time, there was a commotion up in the pilot&rsquo;s
cabin and the one traveler who seemed alone stood
up and quietly ordered everyone to put his hands
up, Nan was taken completely by surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands up, there, you!&rdquo; The remark was addressed
to Nan when she failed to comply with
the first request. She put her hands up. The woman
with the baby screamed. The baby cried. Nan
put her hands down and moved to help the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your hands up there!&rdquo; the order came
again in good American diction. Nan did. The
voice meant business.</p>

<p>Now the plane began to rock. It slowed down
some and glided down a hill of air to taxi across
a field in a place far removed from civilization.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, Nan was really frightened.
Somehow, up in the air, she hadn&rsquo;t been
very scared. It had all happened too suddenly.
Now, with her feet on the ground, however, she
felt as though she was going to faint. She clenched
her fists at her side, gritted her teeth, and stood
waiting for the next move.</p>

<p>It came, quickly. Everyone was ordered to surrender
his pass to cross the border, told to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
his luggage, and then together, they were hurried
over the rough ground to a cabin and locked in.</p>

<p>Shortly, they heard the motors of the great
plane again and then the drone as it swung around
over head and went off in the direction it was
headed for before anything happened&mdash;the
United States.</p>

<p>The passengers, they were only Nan and the
woman with the baby&mdash;the men had all been involved
in the plot&mdash;looked at one another in
consternation. What had happened? Were they
being kidnapped and why? How long would they
be left in this deserted spot?</p>

<p>They tried the doors and the windows. Someone
outside yelled a warning to them. They paced
the floor and the baby cried a pathetic little cry.
They tried to help it, but still it cried, a baffled
little cry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>HAPPILY EVER AFTER!</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Passenger plane X 52 headed toward the border
missing. Nan Sherwood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker Jamieson in a newspaper office in Mexico
City got no further as the news came over the
wire. He grabbed a phone, asked for long distance,
and called the hacienda.</p>

<p>Yes, they had received the news. No, they
didn&rsquo;t know anything beyond what Walker did.
Nan was traveling alone. Walker breathed a deep
sigh of relief at this. He had been afraid that
Alice was with her.</p>

<p>It was all a complete mystery. Couldn&rsquo;t Walker
do something? This plea came from Alice herself
and it wrung his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo; These were the words with which he
hung up and somehow they comforted the young
woman on the phone. She turned to her father
and said simply, &ldquo;It was Walker. He&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Walker did. While government planes
swooped back and forth again and again across
the country looking for a wrecked plane, Walker
was busy working out his own theories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he was calling his New York editor,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a whale of a good story here, one
that&rsquo;s bigger than anyone has guessed. This is no
mere plane accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know? Oh, just smart that way.
Can&rsquo;t tell you more now. Want to go through
with it? It will cost plenty of dough. Need a plane
and a couple of darn good pilots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sky&rsquo;s the limit, you say? Okey-doke.&rdquo; With
this he slammed the receiver down and was off.</p>

<p>He went to the United States Embassy, called
the hacienda again, hired a plane and zoomed off
in the direction X52 was headed for when it disappeared.</p>

<p>For hours he and his pilot combed the district
and found nothing that satisfied Walker. Then,
along about nightfall a lone shack in a deserted
district attracted his attention. The plane dropped
down.</p>

<p>Nan heard it, from her shack prison she heard
it and thought that it was the X52 returning.
While she waited, she didn&rsquo;t know what she
wanted the more&mdash;to have the plane come or
have it stay away. If it stayed away, she thought,
that somehow, some way they could get out of
the cabin, but to what end she couldn&rsquo;t imagine.
In the meantime, she was concerned over the
child and the fear that it would starve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>She waited tensely as the motor died, as she
heard footsteps approaching the cabin.</p>

<p>A voice called.</p>

<p>Where had she heard it before? Could it possibly
be&mdash;Walker! Was she dreaming? She heard
it again. This time she answered and a great flood
of relief came over her. It was he! She ran to
the door and shook it, although she had done it
a dozen times before during the day and nothing
had happened. Because Walker was here now,
because there was someone out there that she
knew, she felt that almost anything might come
true. She pushed and shouted and beat upon the
door.</p>

<p>Walker called to her again. This time she answered.
His relief was as great as hers. She was
alive. His hunch was right! He too beat upon the
door with all his strength, pulled and pushed, but
to no avail. Then he and the pilots got a beam and
rammed it into the unresisting blockade. After
what seemed hours, the door moved on its hinges,
then gave way and Walker found Nan, the pluckiest
little girl in the world he said later, unharmed
by her experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Jamieson,&rdquo; Nan questioned him as
the plane he had brought took to the air with the
pilots and the other prisoners, the woman and
child, &ldquo;how did you guess what had happened?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t hear her at first. He was already busy
planning the release on the tale he had pieced
together.</p>

<p>The lead&mdash;&ldquo;Plucky Nan Sherwood Found
Alive in Deserted Shack in Wilderness. Gang of
smugglers exposed in daring attempt to take plane
load of Chinese across the border.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sounded good, he was thinking, but they really
hadn&rsquo;t been exposed as yet. He knew how they
worked, but he didn&rsquo;t know who they were. He
turned now to Nan to see if he could find a clue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did the men who imprisoned you look
like?&rdquo; he questioned her.</p>

<p>Nan described them briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear or see anyone besides the people
you saw in the plane?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>

<p>Nan hadn&rsquo;t, but as he talked she had an inspiration.
&ldquo;Oh, I know, maybe I can help you!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. Then she told him of the pictures she
had snapped before boarding the transport.</p>

<p>The rest of the plane ride was a dash toward
a place where the pictures could be developed.
One by one they were brought forth from the
developing fluid, until it seemed as though the
inspiration had not been such a fortunate one after
all. But Walker didn&rsquo;t give up. It was the last one
that brought the desired results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I know that man.&rdquo; Walker Jamieson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
summoned forth from his long experience as a
newspaperman, the recollection of a story about
an aviator who had been discharged from the
airplane mail service because of irregularities.
Here was a picture of the man.</p>

<p>Nan took it up and studied it. &ldquo;Why, I know
him too!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; Walker agreed. &ldquo;He was
one of the men who held up the plane, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and not only that,&rdquo; Nan now divulged
a surprising bit of information, &ldquo;he was present
at the bull fight in Mexico City a few days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Walker looked at her
intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was there with a former schoolmate, a
Linda Riggs, and he was introduced to Cousin
Adair by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan searched back in her memory before she
answered. &ldquo;Arthur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howard?&rdquo; Walker supplied the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Nan was smiling now, thinking
of Bess&rsquo;s glee when she found out what a position
Linda would be in when this story came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you perhaps can even locate him,&rdquo; Walker
looked at the amazing youngster beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda is staying&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Nan
looked disappointed as she remembered that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hadn&rsquo;t exchanged addresses with the girl. But it
didn&rsquo;t matter, before the night was over, Linda
Riggs, thoroughly frightened because she had unwittingly
entertained and been entertained by an
international crook, revealed all she knew about
his whereabouts. And before the morning run of
the great metropolitan daily that Walker was
associated with had gone to press, the story was
completed.</p>

<p>Arthur Howard using visitors&rsquo; passes stolen at
the border and altered to suit his needs passed
back and forth freely between the United States
and Mexico. He was engaged in smuggling Chinese
across and in this particularly daring attempt
to finish up a big job had, after he held up the
plane on which Nan had been a passenger, loaded
it heavily with men who had paid high prices to
make the trip.</p>

<p>The Chinese cook at the hacienda had been involved
because he had paid a high price to try to
get a relative of his across. The ring stolen from
Nan was his last desperate effort to finish his payments,
payments which had been draining all of
his resources for months and had taken all of his
life&rsquo;s savings. This was the part of his story that
he had told Nan after she had won his confidence.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Arthur Howard and his gang
were rounded up by a group of United States G-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and he received a long prison sentence after
a startling trial.</p>

<p>But to Nan and her friends at the hacienda, the
most important result of the whole complicated
affair was a certain wedding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cousin just couldn&rsquo;t be mean after
Walker found you,&rdquo; Bess hugged Nan in her excitement.
&ldquo;And there is to be that wedding that
we talked about, and you are going to be maid of
honor and we&rsquo;re all going to be bridesmaids. It
will be in the garden and there will be lots of
guests from all over the country and maybe Walter
will be back here. Oh, Nan, I&rsquo;m so excited!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t the half of it,&rdquo; Nan finished.
&ldquo;Cousin Adair has given this place to Walker and
Alice and he&rsquo;s settled a large sum of money on
them and he&rsquo;s inviting Momsey and Papa down
for the wedding. Oh, Bess, and Rhoda&rsquo;s going to
come too, but not by plane,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Everything
is just perfectly grand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s leave Nan Sherwood and her friends
to a happy, happy time, to finish out a summer in
Mexico that was more exciting than they ever
imagined a summer could possibly be.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
